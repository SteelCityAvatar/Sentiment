I think, when I look at the alternatives available in the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what\u2019s going on in the world, we find it quite attractive. One thing  that may surprise you, but almost everyone I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. *We don\u2019t mind paying taxes at Berkshire and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we\u2019re taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it\u2019s been 52% in the past when I\u2019ve been operating. The federal government owns part of the earnings of the business we make, they don\u2019t own the assets, but they own a percentage of the earnings and they can change that percentage any year. The percentage that they have decreed currently is 21%, and I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give. I think that the higher taxes are quite likely and the government wants to take a greater share of your income\u2026* he continues the country has been good to Berkshire and that shareholder should welcome returning dollars to the government.\n\nHis sale of apple is simply his way of hedging against increasing tax rates for capital gains.

I'm a sucker for turn around stories. \n\nHere is an example. Citi group bank has done, and is still doing, tons of boneheaded things. But they have an absolute monopoly that is virtually unimpeachable in cross boarder business accounts and this business segment produces and will continue to produce, so long as a one world currency doesn't come into being and the dollar maintains it's top billing, 30 dollars a share per year in value. Presently the shares are trading near 60. So one business segment, that basically can't be messed up, is half the value and the whole rest of the business, for all its faults, is the other half.

I hate buying higher. I would rather take a drop right out the gate than have to buy higher later. (3) Highly controversial - use the charts to aid timing. Look for consolidations and breakouts. If something appears close to breaking out, don't wait, because you can easily miss tens of percent pretty quickly (this is a very dark art and always prone to some degree of error, but as long as it is better than random, it still has some value). (4) Make sure you are truly comfortable with your target size. Perhaps you are tending to oversize and those little thoughts are actually doing you a favour and preventing your from over-risking. The root cause of this issue is on some level lack of confidence, but at least in my case, when I lacked confidence, it was for a good reason - I didn't really know what I was doing.

Michael Burry got his start in penny stocks on Silicon Investor. For the value convergence to work, you have to write your theses and make them public so that people buy into them.\n\nIf listed, you should be able to find good info on them, since they need to provide audited reports, but even that is hit or miss, depending on the auditor. There are many scammy auditors who deal in penny stocks, just like that one which was auditing DJT and got banned or something like that.\n\nMost of the time, you need to actively trade these and not really \"invest\" in them. It is a numbers game where you will have many losers, but few large runners which should more than compensate for the small losses. Small losses do accumulate and are hard to deal with psychologically, but if you think you have an edge in finding the few gems then you have to withstand the small loses. Death by 1000 small cuts is a thing.\n\nA word of caution: most of the time they will run up a lot only to return back to the prior level if not even lower, as they get promoted by nefarious groups like the Atlas Trading group. You need to be able to sniff the promotions before they happen, as whoever is planning the promotion, accumulates the shares. If the volume is so thin, the accumulation might become obvious, so if you buy at that time, you need to watch it like a hawk and sell when the promotion starts and the promoters inevitably dump their shares.\n\nHere is a post I wrote on it, if you are interested.

It seems from remitly 10k annual report that they have some type of partnerships with banks which they call 'disbursements' whereas Wise has actually built the infrastructure in their host countries which allows them to bypass the partneships and offer lower % fees to customers (obviously this requires higher upfront capex). To me this seems like Wise has the long term moat here and will beat remitly.\n\nSome other posts about them from a couple of years ago. Wise has continued to get much better growth and products since then:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/13x8tf6/wise\\_plc\\_costco\\_of\\_crossborder\\_payments/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/13x8tf6/wise_plc_costco_of_crossborder_payments/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/u8rp1o/wizey\\_wise\\_plc\\_what\\_am\\_i\\_missing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/u8rp1o/wizey_wise_plc_what_am_i_missing/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UKInvesting/comments/qfmhy5/wise\\_stock\\_is\\_a\\_lost\\_cause\\_with\\_a\\_lot\\_of\\_downside/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKInvesting/comments/qfmhy5/wise_stock_is_a_lost_cause_with_a_lot_of_downside/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/u8rp1o/wizey\\_wise\\_plc\\_what\\_am\\_i\\_missing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/u8rp1o/wizey_wise_plc_what_am_i_missing/)\n\n",

A bottom-up valuation, & a top-down valuation. Can someone give me an example of how exactly these valuation techniques differ? \n\nFrom what I understand, a bottom-up approach starts with analyzing a company\u2019s figures and past performance to get a picture of what their future may look like. Then you\u2019ll usually start projecting their future revenues, operating margins, reinvestment needs, and so on until you get an estimate for their cash flows that you\u2019ll discount back to the present to get an estimate for the companies value.\n\nWhere a top down approach is a lot more qualitative and focuses on the big picture things that can impact a company. So, it could be something like you think oil prices are going to rise due to turmoil in wherever which will cause oil stocks to rise. Or maybe you think the antitrust lawsuit against Google is overblown, or that rising T.bond yields will help boost banks profits.\n\nPersonally though I\u2019m not comfortable predicting macroeconomic movements, but I like crunching the numbers and I think it\u2019s important to have a story that goes along with them. So, I\u2019d say my style of analysis is a blend of bottom up and top down. For example, if you\u2019re valuing a company that\u2019s been struggling to turn a profit for years, and you\u2019re projecting that they\u2019ll be profitable for the next 10 years then you should have a good story to explain that change.\n\n\n> Also, how can I learn \u2014 as a layman \u2014 to construct detailed & proper valuation models?\n\nI would highly recommend checking out Professor Aswath Damodaran from the NYU School of Business as he posts all of his lectures from his valuation courses on YouTube. There are courses for undergrad and MBA students, as well as some intro to accounting and statistics courses, so people with any level of knowledge should be able to find a good starting point. He also has a couple incredibly detailed valuation models that are available for anyone to download, and there are some accompanying videos that will walk you through using them.\n\nOn that note, I learned how to build models through his posts which is why I recommend him so much. That said the valuation models may seem overwhelming at first glance, or at least they did to me, but if you break them down piece by piece then you\u2019ll find there\u2019s nothing too complicated going on.\n\nThey\u2019re almost always built around projecting future revenues, operating income, cash flows to the firm or cash flows to equity, and the cost of capital. So, once you get a grasps on those terms you\u2019ll be able to build up a model however you want, and you\u2019ll be able to understand most anyone else\u2019s valuation.",

So this would mean the P/E ratio can be thought of as a ratio between these cashflows and the earnings per share.\n\nSay we have a trailing P/E of 10. Would it make sense to then say that this means the market expects $1 of last years earnings will be 'used' to generate $10 of free cash flow over the lifetime of this company? If not, what does this ratio mean to you?",

A higher P/E ratio could mean the market thinks the company's earnings will grow a lot in the future. \n\nThinking of it directly as how much free cash flow each dollar of earnings will generate is a little sus. There's a lot more that goes into DCF than just the P/E ratio, like future growth rates, discount rates, and capital expenditures. \n\nIf you want to learn more about this stuff, I found this book called [Valuation](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/1259581276) hella helpful.

You know, you have no issue yelling at suppliers, or pissing off politicians or even your friends, because the company is important to you.\n\nIt's something that I got from understanding the movie business. When people care about a project, they often produce something great on a fairly low budget. Like John Wick cost $25m. Deadpool cost about $60m. The people involved were passionate about them. Those Jurassic World films cost like $170m and are rubbish, because no-one cares. People have just turned up for Jurassic World to buy a beach house.\n\nDoes your CEO have a burning passion to put a PC on every desk, or to make cheap flights available for Eastern Europeans, or to make better vacuum cleaners and hair dryers? If they don't, if it's one of a dozen CEO jobs they could take, how much are they going to care, how hard are they going to work, how ruthless are they going to be, how deep are they going to get into understanding what customers care about?\n\nAnd founders nearly always have this, but sometimes you get CEOs who do too. Like Michael O'Leary didn't found Ryanair, but he clearly loves it. He's been running it for nearly 40 years. He could stop tomorrow and go and sit on a beach, but he doesn't.\n\nIt's why I like earnings calls. You can pick things up about people's character.",

My daughter worked for a family owned ($100M revenues) seafood business, and the nepotism was rife.  DNA trumped competence every time. \n\n2. If the company is public and has two classes of stock, stay away. The issue here is that the family has minimal financial skin in the game but control of the Board. This leads to all sorts of distortions such as jets and helicopters so they can go skiing in Aspen on the shareholder's dime.  Basically, outside passive minority shareholders have not recourse.  I discuss this topic in this (long) post here: [https://investingliteracy.substack.com/p/equity-investing?utm\\_source=publication-search](https://investingliteracy.substack.com/p/equity-investing?utm_source=publication-search)\n\n3.

After all, it\u2019s not like a weakening consumer is going to bring mortgage default rates to a dangerous level.\u00a0\n\nApple operating profit 10 years ago was at about $50b, so unless 1 is approximately true, it has not been the same for a decade.\u00a0\n\nAnd sure, Buffett is hesitant to sell things because they\u2019ve gone up - certainly the bar to do so is a lot higher than the to buy them in the first place - but why does he have that philosophy?Largely because excellent companies tend to surprise to the upside (I don\u2019t mean on earnings day, I mean long term), and an ability to compound capital at high rates of return can often grind down a high PE pretty quickly. But when your market cap is >$3T and earnings $100b, it\u2019s very hard to surprise much to the upside, and it\u2019s hard to invest proportionally large amounts of capital at high rates of return. As the valuation goes up (as it has done) and the growth story comes down (as it has done, at least disregarding AI), the maths of DCF shift pretty quickly to make it unattractive to remain invested, let alone buy in the first place.

        "post_date": "2024-08-04T17:05:47",
        "post_body": "Hey Crypto Enthusiasts and Future CaptchaCoin Pioneers,\n\nWe are thrilled to unveil CaptchaCoin.net, a revolutionary cryptocurrency that pioneers the concept of proof-of-human-work. Designed to democratize mining and distribution, CaptchaCoin ensures that everyone, not just a few, can benefit from the power of cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is CaptchaCoin?\n\nCaptchaCoin is built on the foundation of proof-of-human-work, a groundbreaking approach that makes mining and participating in our network accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems, CaptchaCoin verifies legitimate human users through captchas, making mining straightforward and equitable.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\t1.\tCaps and Logs:\n\t\u2022\tThe main unit of currency is the Cap, with a fixed supply of 1 billion. Symbol $CAPS\n\t\u2022\tLogs are a secondary unit mined alongside Caps, tied permanently to your wallet, and cannot be traded.\n\n\t2.\tProof of Human-Work:\n\t\u2022\tCaptchas ensure that only real humans can mine Caps, promoting fairness and accessibility.\n\t\u2022\tCaptchaCoin secures the network through human interaction, preventing industrial-scale mining.\n\n\t3.\tUser-Friendly and Versatile:\n\t\u2022\tQuick Caps: Enable microtransactions for accessing content, perfect for news sites and content creators.\n\t\u2022\tEasy Invoicing: Set up stores and accept payments with minimal technical skills.\n\n\t4.\tSocial Media Verification:\n\t\u2022\tUse your Logs to verify social media comments, ensuring genuine human interaction and reducing spam.\n\nTools for Content Creators:\n\nCaptchaCoin makes it easy to send small amounts of Caps online, making it ideal for digital creators to get rewarded for their work.\n\n\tThe Simple Paywall:\n\t\u2022\tAny digital content can be placed behind a CaptchaCoin Simple Paywall. Users solve a CaptchaCoin captcha before viewing the content, with 100% of the mined Caps going directly to your wallet.\n\n\t\u2022\tSince it only takes a matter of seconds to solve a captcha with no direct financial cost to the user, this should result in a high conversion rate. This innovative approach to monetizing content means creators can receive a small reward from the vast majority of their userbase.\n\n\t\u2022\tA tipping wallet allows any user to mine Caps for anyone else in a secure manner. A wallet can be created on behalf of a content creator, but to prevent scammers, only the named individual can redeem the Caps.\n\n\t\u2022\tMuch like the Simple Paywall, the tipping wallet has a very low threshold for the average user to contribute, encouraging a higher level of donations than traditional options.\n\nSmall Block Mining:\n\nCaptchaCoin will offer two forms of mining and two types of blocks. Small block mining will be sequential, meaning many miners attempt to solve the same captchas, and only the fastest miner will gain the block rewards.\n\nThis means small block miners will need a higher expected return from mining to account for the increased uncertainty. This will be tested by offering a range of different mining success rates and reward multipliers to determine the correct ratio:\n\n\t\u2022\t10% chance to successfully mine, 12.5x reward (expected return: 1.25x)\n\n\t\u2022\t1% chance to successfully mine, 150x reward (expected return: 1.5x)\n\n\t\u2022\t0.1% chance to successfully mine, 2000x reward (expected return: 2x)\n\nUnsuccessful attempts to mine will result in 0 Caps earned, 0 logs, and will not reset your \u2018last mined\u2019 timer for daily rewards.\n\nMining Difficulty Levels:\n\nIncrease the number of Captchas shown to mine more Caps per solve:\n\n\t\u2022\t8 Captchas shown\n\t\u2022\t16 Captchas shown\n\t\u2022\t32 Captchas shown\n\t\u2022\t64 Captchas shown\n\nEnter the CaptchaCoin Lottery for the chance to win! \n\nProof of Human Work\n\nCaptchaCoin is secured through proof of human-work. The Captchas are designed to be impossible for machines to solve, but very simple for humans: users simply identify the image displaying 3 letters which have been distorted, then input these characters. Correctly solving a Captcha directly secures the network by contributing to block validation. In order to control the network, it will be necessary to have a majority of man-hours, which is impossible in a highly distributed network.\n\nPre-launch\n\nMany cryptocurrencies today use proof-of-work, which gives the vast majority of power to a small number of miners operating on an industrial scale. It is almost impossible for the average user to mine any currency or influence the network. The common alternative, proof-of-stake, ensures existing currency holders control the network and typically receive additional financial benefits. Newcomers to the network are often at a severe disadvantage to the early adopters.\n\nCaptchaCoin\u2019s use of proof of human-work balances the playing field: all users are equal independent of the computational power they have or their existing balance. This will ensure a large network that will continually grow with new users who can easily mine their own Caps.\n\nThe Captchas are designed solely for the use of securing the CaptchaCoin network - they are not used anywhere else on the internet. A key feature in their design is scalability. Any given Captcha can be made instantly harder by expanding the range of possible solutions the user has to choose from, meaning the same amount of human-work can be captured using fewer computing resources.\n\nIn the future, it will be essential that new Captchas are generated in a way that prevents anyone from knowing their solution. They will be created randomly to ensure no one person can pre-determine them, using an independently verified machine to prove their solution is destroyed after their creation.\n\nRollout Overview\n\nCaptchaCoin\u2019s mission is to become a global currency used to facilitate day-to-day transactions both online and offline. The vast majority of people do not own a single crypto token as mining is too technologically difficult, or they are not willing to risk their money to acquire any. Proof of human-work mining removes these barriers to entry entirely.\n\nThis uniquely accessible, equitable approach to mining will create the perfect environment for a rapidly growing userbase, though this process will take many years. Below we will outline how this will be achieved by expanding CaptchaCoin\u2019s network, features, and usability.\n\nPhase 0: Proof of Concept\nInitial features will be extremely limited, and the very early adopters mining during this stage will be those genuinely interested in the concept of CaptchaCoin and proof of human-work. Minor parts of the blockchain will be phased in, and prototypes of novel use-cases will be introduced. There will be no marketing or efforts to expand the userbase, though some growth through word-of-mouth is expected.\n\nThis phase will last until 5% of the pre-launch Caps have been mined.\n\nPhase 1: Technological Upgrades\nThroughout this phase, there will be regular rollouts of the underlying blockchain technology with a corresponding increase in functionality. Blocks will be issued every minute and will contain all of the transactions and records from a standard blockchain, though it will not be possible for users to create their own blocks - this will still be centrally controlled. Features and use-cases will be refined and made ready for a wider, non-technical audience. As these are developed, CaptchaCoin will be shared with existing crypto-enthusiasts through existing online channels. CaptchaCoin will begin to have a social media presence.\n\nThis phase will continue until 10% of pre-launch Caps have been mined. It is important to note that during the early phases, the price of a Cap can only increase - by design the price is set intentionally low and there are no mechanisms for it to decrease.\n\nPhase 2: Expanding the Userbase\nThe final elements of the blockchain technology will be released, thereby establishing CaptchaCoin as a \u201ctrue\u201d cryptocurrency, which will allow for initial conversations with exchanges to list Caps. During this phase, it is essential to expand the userbase to those not traditionally involved in crypto. CaptchaCoin will have established use-cases for fee-free low-value transactions, including indirect payment through mining to a non-technical audience, giving it a considerable advantage over all other cryptocurrencies.\n\nPhase 3: Launch\nCaptchaCoin will be listed on exchanges and during this stage, there will be very high price volatility. Because of the initial mining structure, there is an expectation that the wallets with the highest number of Caps will be held by early adopters that are invested for the long term and will not instantly dump their Caps, but naturally, there will be a lot of unknowns during this time.\n\nPhase 4: Consistent Growth\nAt launch, fewer than 10% of all Caps will have been mined and CaptchaCoin will have reached but a fraction of its potential userbase. CaptchaCoin will continue to achieve growth by delivering practical use-cases that encourage growth both online and offline. We are currently at the first step on a journey of a 1,000 miles and we hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\nJoin Us on This Journey:\n\nWe are at the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency with CaptchaCoin, and we want you to be part of it. By mining Caps during our pre-launch phase, you can be among the first to experience and benefit from our unique approach.\n\n\t\u2022\tStart mining your first Caps now at Captchacoin.net \n\n\t\u2022\tFollow us on our social media channels:\n\n\t\u2022\twww.twitter.com/captchacoinnet\n\nTogether, we can make CaptchaCoin a global currency that is fair, accessible, and beneficial for all.\n\nCaptchaCoin - Power to the People, One Captcha at a Time\n",

Lower interest rates are better for small caps as it reduces interest burden which they are relatively more susceptible too due to risk factors but if they don\u2019t have sufficient growth potential as well as paths to profitability the stocks won\u2019t move",

It varies by state, but here's how it goes in NYC for uninvited trespassing squatters in your privately owned home: \n\n\"In New York, the eviction process for squatters can take 30 days to over a year. The process involves several steps, including:\n1. Serve a 10-day notice\nThe property owner must serve the squatter with a 10-day notice to vacate the property.\n2. Start a removal proceeding\nIf the squatter doesn't leave after the notice, the property owner must start a removal proceeding in the local court. The court date must be scheduled between 10 and 17 days after the notice is served.\n3. File a petition\nThe property owner must file a petition for special proceedings with the court to begin the eviction process.\n4. Obtain a summons\nThe court will issue a summons, which is served by the sheriff, requiring the squatter to appear in court.\"\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=how+long+to+evict+squatters+nyc&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari\n\nFor California:\nEvicting a squatter in California can take at least 3\u20134 months from start to finish, but the timeline can vary. The process is similar to evicting a tenant who doesn't have a lease or isn't paying rent:\n1. Serve a notice\nThe property owner must serve the squatter with an eviction notice based on the reason for eviction:\nLess than one year: 30-day notice to quit\nMore than one year: 60-day notice to quit\nNonpayment of rent: 3-day notice to pay rent or quit\nLease violations: 3-day notice to cure or quit\n2. Initiate legal action\nIf the squatter doesn't leave after receiving the notice, the property owner can consult a real estate attorney to discuss legal eviction proceedings. The attorney may recommend requesting an immediate order of possession. If the squatter files an answer, a hearing will be scheduled within 20 days. If the squatter doesn't have a valid claim to adverse possession, the judge will rule in the owner's favor.\n3. Serve a Writ of Execution\nThe owner can present the judgment to the local sheriff, who will serve the squatter a Writ of Execution. The squatter will have five days to move out after the writ is posted. If they don't, they can be forcibly removed.\"",

Morgan\n\n\"While the data spans from 1998 to 2017 and might seem dated, its 20-year period offers enduring insights. As illustrated, the average investor's return during this timeframe was 2.6%, marginally above the average annualized inflation rate of 2.1%. The typical retail investor barely achieved positive real returns from their investments. More critically, they lagged the S&P 500's average annual return by a substantial 5.2%.\"",

        "post_date": "2024-08-03T18:23:51",
        "post_body": "I started another thread on buying Amazon during the dip.  It got a lot of good response, but many might say, \"Well Warren would never invest in Amazon because it is not a value company.\"\n\nTo that end, with a nod to Patrick Lencioni, I have created a business fable on how Warren Buffet might invest in Amazon based on business strategy first, which he ends up calling \"a moat.\"\n\nIf you lead hard with hard metrics, I invite you to exit now.  The following will just drive you crazy.\n\n*********Reminder, this is a business fable for discussion only********\n\nSetting the stage:\n\nWe see Ted Weschler, Buffet's guy that got Warren to invest in Apple, just about to walk into Warren's office.  Ted's got a bug to get Warren to invest in Amazon.\n\nTed always drops by in the morning because Warren is in a good mood, and actually Warren still has a bit of his Sausage Egg McMuffin left on his desktop when Ted walks in.\n\n\"Hey, Warren, got a moment to chat?\" asks Ted\n\n\"Sure, pull up a chair Ted,\"  Warren motions.  \"Want a Cherry Coke?\"\n\n\"I'll pass,\" says Ted.  He sits down, and he continues, \"Hey Warren, just looking at the Amazon results.  Their sales were down a little, but I'm still modelling them at about $55B worth of cash flow this year.\"\n\nWarren looks blankly for 2 seconds at the wall.  Ted already knows what's coming, and it amazes him, although at 93 years of age, Warren shouldn't be able to do this.\n\n\"Okay, so that puts them at about 55% of the Apple cash flow, so what does that put them in the Fortune 500? About 6th on the list this year?\" replies Warren.\n\n\"I have them modeled at 5th, but more than that Warren, I have them at $80B next year,\" says Ted\n\n\"Is Apple going to be flat?\" says Warren.  But Ted knows that Warren already knows the answer and doesn't need an answer.  \"So that's going to put them into the top 3.\"\n\n\"Yup,\" says Ted, \"And I think they are on track to get to Apple in the next couple of year.\"\n\n\"It's the credit card float that you've been telling me about,\" said Warren.  Now Warren makes this comment, but he doesn't need an answer.  Warren know all about credit cards, and Ted sees Warren's American Express that he took out to give to his admin earlier.  Basically Amazon's retail business is all credit cards from consumers.  People pay for their order, and Amazon gets money immediately.  They pay their suppliers in 90 days.  This generates massive cash flow that is almost unstoppable in its growth.\n\n\"What happened to that big bet where they were trying to ramp their warehouses during Covid and put in too much capex? You brought this to me before, and told me they needed to get through this issue?\" Warren says.  \"Well, I know you.  They are through it, and this is why they are on such a great path.  Okay, I'll bite.  They got great cash flow, so what are they going to do with it?\"\n\nTed takes a big gulp, because this is where he had to pass the rubicon with Apple.  \"They are investing it in the computing cloud.\"\n\nWarren sighs.  Ted knows that Warren has always hated technology companies.  It not that he hates technology per se.  It that Warren hates having to try and ascribe a tangible value to IP.  \n\n\"Okay Ted,\" say Warren.  \"Let me know your going to tell me why this is just like Apple.\"\nTed laughs.  \"Yeah, but you use Amazon already, so it's not like I have to talk you into using an iPhone.\"\n\nWarren for a moment looks wishfully at his desk drawer where he still keeps his trusty Samsung flip phone.\n\nTed knows that look. Warren still complains about the iPhone today.  He keeps saying what America needs is an updated flip phone with weather and stock quotes.  So Ted quickly launches into an explanation to keep this subject from coming up again.\n\nTed summarizes as follows:\n\n\n* Ted talks to more detail on the cash generated by the credit card float\n* He explains that Amazon is now at 40% of the online sales, with no risk of slipping back due to their ability to deliver 90% of items in two days, which is a massive moat that nobody else can get to\n* *He explains that 25% of US shipments are via the web, and he thinks this doesn't hit saturation for another 10 years.\n\n\"Okay Ted,\" says Warren.  \"You got me convince on the cash flow.  But this seems to be all high tech and high risk.\"\n\nTed has been preparing for this, so he tries to do a simple explanation of the cloud.\n\n* The bulk of the cloud is something called IaaS, which means that the end user simply assembles a virtual computer.\n* He explains that while some PaaS is around, it's no different at a person running Excel on their laptop.  \n* He explains that there is a massive moat of needing to have your data centers in areas around the world for fail over and redundancy.  Right now, really only Microsoft and Google have a chance of being able to do something similar and offer it for general sale\n* He points that these are real assets with real value, locked up for many years.  Amazon uses REITs as off balance sheet financing, but it is virtual assets that only they can get to.\n\n\"So what you are telling me,\" interrupts Buffet, \"They sound just like a utility company.\"  \n\nTed thinks to himself.  \"Ah, I was too obvious and he got there first.  I wanted to deliver the line.\"  However, Ted is pretty pleased with himself that he got Warren over the technology barrier.\n\n\"Exactly right Warren.  When these data centers started, there was so much new technology and features that it was just a crazy pit of competing tech.  However, it has settle down to much more component level.  There could differentiate on the PaaS, but this is a pretty small part of their business, and I don't think we need to worry about it.  Probably the biggest competitor is Bill's company, but it appears to me they are slowly letting it settle out in the market place.  Amazon is slowly letting in Microsoft and Microsoft is slowly taking share.  Even with the share loss, Amazon is growing every year and I see this as continuing for the next ten years.  Right now we are seeing the creation of Coke and Pepsi.\"\n\nWarren pauses for a second, \"And which one is Coke?\"  He smiles for a while knowing that Ted would never have brought him Pepsi.  \n\nTed was fighting a little dirty by bringing in Microsoft.  He knows Warren loves to chat with Bill, and he knew that Warren was going to get on the phone and talk with him about his idea.  This was going to be a double edge sword because Bill was going to go crazy if Warren said he was considering investing in Amazon and not Microsoft.  However, he knew Bill was going to tell Warren the truth.  And Ted really did believe that Amazon was Coke.\n\n\"Amazon's cash is generated from real sales selling real stuff.  While Microsoft has a massive franchise in software, you can't beat the retail model.  Sure, Microsoft has more cash, but in another five years, Amazon is going to crush them on cash flow.  This is about Capex and investment, and Amazon's retail model is unique.  But lets say we have an issue in the cloud part, if Amazon optimized their Opex vs sales and said that they were going to go for profit instead of cash, we wouldn't be hurt that bad.  Microsoft has no fallback outside software. \n It's built in diversification.  But this is a fallback.  The reason to invest is because we want to get into the IT Utility business.\"\n\n\"Okay Ted,\" replies Warren.  \"You know the drill.  What are your main concerns?\"\n\n\"I'd like them to be bigger in international sales, they have to go global, but it's up to 23% of their sales.  The international business is break even.  Sure it generates cash, but there no margin of safety.  However, they've made a lot of progress.  Secondly, I don't about this AI tech that looks like it is going to come into the utility data centers.\"\n\n\"Well, what does Jeanine say about it?\" asked Warren.\n\nJeannie is Berkshire hidden geek.  She absolutely hates having anybody even know that she works at Berkshire because she doesn't want any attention.   She live just a few doors down from Warren, and has been known to pick him up every once in a while.  She tells all her neighbors that she knows Warren because they employ her to clean the office during the day.\n\nHowever, she holds a double PhD from MIT in material science and theoretical accounting.  She did her post-doc work at Cal-Tech on a branch of biotech completely unrelated to her Ph.Ds.  Whenever the group wants somebody to do a tech analysis, they ask Jeanine to look at it.  \n\n\"Jeannie says it's complex.  Basically it should follow the exact same path as the rest of the components in the data center, but it's dominated by nVidia Cuda layer due to the way programmers due things.  She says that this is under debate, and keeps muttering about \"Hacker News\" under her breath.  Something about PyTorch or Tensorflow.  It's all really complex, and she loses me.   However, she says she thinks that things are going to become much more clear over the next 36 months.  She says it shouldn't stop us from investing now.\"\n\n\"Ted you know the issue,\" says Warren.  \"Ramp versus initial buy size.\"\n\nTed hates this part of the conversation.  Warren is hung up on the fact that in certain industries he can't make a small buy anymore.  Basically once he buys, it sends such a strong signal that the stock price goes crazy.  Then when he buys again, he feels he has over paid.  Warren keeps telling him that if Ted sees a big position, he has to buy big immediately and not spread it out.\n\n\"Yes, Warren.  I see this as another Apple.  If this play doesn't get to 20% of our holding, I'd be disappointed.  But this is killing me.  We are sitting on so much cash.  It's worth investing and not waiting.  Everything else is just so overvalued.  I don't want to go big now, but we should take a position,\" says Ted.\n\n\"Well Ted,\" says Warren.  \"I already know you've run this past everybody else.  What do they think?\"\n\n\"Just as you know Warren.  It's the ramp versus the entry.  We got a couple of hold outs on wanting to see the AI issue resolved,\" says Ted.\n\n\"Okay, put it on the list,\" says Warren.  \"As Charlie used to say, we only make two decisions per year that makes any difference.  So, we need to watch this one.  My gut tells me we are going to invest, but its more of a question of when due to our size.\"  The list includes about 100 different value metric comparisons that Warren wanted to see.  Luckily, Ted has a staff to help on this. \n\nTed is rather pleased with himself as he expected Warren to fight quite a bit more.  Normally, it would have taken another year to get it on the list.  \n\n\"I'm really figuring the old cogger out,\" he thinks to himself.  \"I don't know how much longer he'll be with us, and now I'm finally dialing in his number.  It only took me 14 years to get to this place,\" he finishes thinking to himself.\n\nHowever, the conversation has gone on for quite a while.  Suddenly, he wants that Cherry Coke.\n\n\"Warren, can I get that Coke now?\" asks Ted\n\n\"Sure help yourself,\" says Warren.\n\nThe mini-fridge was behind Warren's desk.  Ted walks around the desk.  As he gets his Coke, he spies a printout of the Amazon quarter investor's presentation poking out from a folder and he notices their 10K.  Then he sees Warren's notepad on the desk, with a date and the name \"Bill\" on top of a bulleted list.\n\nThe bottom bullet says, \"Bill keeps saying buy Microsoft....  Bridge night is going to be murder if I do this.\"\n\nTed smiles to himself as he walks out of the office.",

If we rewind the clock to 2020, MSFT had deep pockets, a legacy software franchise that generated cash, and a \"modest\" cloud capex budget of $17B or about 1/3 of their FCF.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2024, MSFT will need to invest around $50B in cloud capex. While they will make around $75B in free cash flow their dividend will remove $20B out of this. They basically need to invest all of their cash flow into the cloud. The cloud is a Capex business, and therefore MSFT won't be able to finance from operations, and need to go further into debt.\r\n\r\nAmazon is in the opposite issue. With their \"bad choice\" from Covid, they had to take on debt to continue their cloud expansion. However, it actually turns out that the retail side of Amazon is a cash machine. The fact that they don't pay a dividend is a massive help so that cash flow will be much better than MSFT by next year.\r\n\r\nNow, they do have more debt than MSFT, so you have two ships passing in the night. One that is increasing debt (MSFT) and one that is trying to get rid of their debt (Amazon). On top of this, Amazon has to feed the retail capex needs also, so they have more balls to juggle.\r\n\r\nHowever, given just \"turning the crank\" for Amazon retail, by the time Azure catches AWS, AWS will probably have more cash flexibility to feed the machine. MSFT can take on debt, but they will do it cautiously.\r\n\r\nNet-net: I'm saying they will be Coke and Pepsi. Neither will have a big enough CapEx budget to hurt the other without damaging both themselves and the industry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1eifsuy/comment/lgejwwf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

It still looks AI to me\n\n**Warren Buffett, the legendary investor known for his wisdom and knack for picking winners, sat in his office in Omaha, Nebraska, surrounded by stacks of financial reports and investment books. The sun streamed through the large windows, casting a warm glow on his desk. Buffett was deep in thought, considering his next big move. He had always been a fan of companies that had a clear path to sustained success, but lately, he found himself fascinated by the way Amazon had transformed the retail landscape.\n\nIt was a crisp autumn morning when Buffett\u2019s phone rang. On the other end was a familiar voice: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Bezos and Buffett had developed a mutual respect over the years, often exchanging insights on business strategy and innovation.\n\n\u201cWarren, I\u2019ve been thinking about something,\u201d Bezos began. \u201cAmazon has evolved significantly since its early days. We started with books, then expanded into nearly every retail sector. Now, we\u2019re focusing on new areas like cloud computing, AI, and even space exploration.

        "post_body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m transitioning into becoming a full-time investor and I\u2019m seeking advice on how to effectively spend my time. I want to make sure I\u2019m being productive and not wasting efforts. \n\n1. **Daily Routine**: What does your typical day look like as a full-time investor? I have no idea on how to create a daily routine. I try searching online for it, reading material on the subject, spending hours thinking about the best routine I could create, and so on, but I am not comfortable with any of my previous results.\n2. **Learning**: How much time do you spend on research and learning new strategies? What resources do you recommend? I really need to read at least one book every 3-4 weeks. It is kind a hard to study, research for stocks, administrate a portfolio, and to do a deep analysis all together.\n3. **Networking**: How important is networking in investing, and how do you go about it? It is hard to find people outside this community who is orientated towards the Value Investment philosophy.\n4. **Tools and Platforms**: Which tools and platforms do you find indispensable for your work? I am currently using [TIKR.com](http://TIKR.com) and would like to subscribe to Bloomberg Terminal but it is so expensive that I may hold on that thought. \n5. **Maintaining Work-Life Balance**: How do you manage to maintain a healthy work-life balance? And this is as hard as fuck to me but I guess that if I could have some useful routines this would solve itself.\n\nAny tips, resources, or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!",

I also read a lot of stock reports, spend time constructing models, and generally just trying to make sure I don't screw up my own strategies(a good chunk of my income is from futures swing trading). I don't network at all for finance but when friends and family ask questions I answer(usually with \"buy an index fund\"). As for tools, I use SeekingAlpha and TradingView.

Like - single or married, kids or no kids, expectations - beat market to start fund later or just make more than living expense or goal is to hit some financial number. Things you value in life - health, travel, or do you consider this as your phase to print as much money as you can. Such details will define how your WL balance will look and how you approach your day/week/month. **You're your own boss so create a routine that fits you and your goals.**\n* Learning - we all know we need to constantly learn in this game but you need to prioritize very carefully what you read rather than just pick what someone recommends around you. **Most of your learning list should originate from what you want to accomplish at that moment.**\n* Tools - simpler the toolkit the better it is. **If you're doing just long term investing I don't think you need more than value line, a screener site, VIC and SEC filings to start your journey**. Think of yourself as a startup founder who needs to be resourceful - try to find free stuff and pay only for those tools where value >>> price. Bloomberg terminal is not important unless you want to be event driven trader. I am not sure why at such small portfolio NAV you would waste 25k every year.\n* Networking - Not sure where you live but in the US you can find many people who do value investing but I don't know why you would even care unless you want to start a fund later. If you want my 2 cents, **spend next 3-5 years be a loner (not in life but just in investing)  to learn and build your own playbook.** Right now networking is distraction. Also you would mostly find fund managers or part time casual investors in these networking sessions and rarely someone who is all in - private full time investor.\n\n**Other points:**\n\n* Read for a start:  **Free Capital: How 12 private investors made millions in the stock market by Guy Thomas**. It has stories of 12 people who did what you're trying to accomplish with information on how they did - including their daily routines and investing style (value or growth investing, day or swing trading etc). It will give you some ideas.\n* **Be prepared for mood swings** - you will only get paid when you win regardless of how much effort you put in. It is not a job where paycheck will come just bec you showed up and did some work. You could work day and night and still lose on the investment. It is tough pill to swallow but over time you will learn to take emotions out of the game.\n* Very few people will understand what you do. It is okay till you know where you're going and what needs to be done.\n* **Focus will be your key if you want to succeed as a private investor.** With no boss you can  easily get distracted and spend days doing nothing productive. Make sure you have some check-ins mechanism with yourself to **ensure even if days/weeks are not useful that does not happen on months/quarters timeframe.**\n\nFinally regardless of how it goes just remember it will be a fun journey. You will learn a lot about yourself and your emotions.  If you succeed in becoming a decent FT private investor there is no greater financial happiness - **making a buttload of money with no boss or clients and all the time independence to do whatever you want.**\n\nI'm rooting for you.

        "post_body": "In counter to the ranging conversation on Intel, to me the obvious results from yesterday is buy the Amazon dip.\n\nThe street was looking for $148.8B revenue and they did $148.0B\nHowever, earnings killed it.  They did $14.7 vs the street $13.6B\n\nMore than that, everybody was concerned that AWS wouldn't hit expectations after MSFT, and AWS did better.\n\nThe result?  Amazon falls 10%.\n\nVery simply, Amazon is now trading in the 30s for a PE, which is clearly under their historical mean.  To suggest that this stock price makes sense, you need to argue the following:\n\n* Amazon has systemic issues\n* Amazon retail deserves a LOWER multiple that Walmart on EPS\n* The Cloud market is going to crater, and deserves a multiple the same as retail\n\nNow, when you have an event like this, you get a bunch of headlines that try to give a reason for the dip.  Some cite that the current quarter outlook wasn't as strong as what the street wanted.  However, this is often the case at Amazon.  Some cite that the revenues disappointed, but this really is fx, which should be a reasonable reason beyond Amazon's control.\n\nHowever, this is not what I see.  Amazon delivers exceptionally well.  They continue to put pressure on all normal retail stores.  I only find myself buy more and more on Amazon, not less and less.  More people are buying online, and Amazon is still slowly gaining share.\n\nSo what do you have left?  Basically, the street wanted to see their internal advertising growth 24% year or year.  It \"only\" grew 20%.\n\nTo me, this is Mr Market missing the boat, and if you are wiling to do a sum of the parts and compare Amazon to their peers, this is a buying opp.",

AMZN stands out to me as one of the most appealing of the MAG7, especially during this dip.\n\nI say this because AWS and advertising are growing at insane rates and these are two sectors that will be invaluable in the future. Amazon is also in a great position to have some of the most user-targeted advertisements out there because they are able to track consumer spending, I'm not expecting their ad business to halt anytime soon. Additionally AWS is devouring market share and AMZN is investing in it heavily going forward.\n\nAMZN is also going to benefit MASSIVELY from development in robotics. This would boost the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their retail sector tremendously.\n\nI am surprised that they missed the revenue forecast, however in the sectors that are most important they slaughtered. This gives me great conviction in their business and overall I find the ER quite bullish.\n\nIn my opinion Amazon's weaknesses are guidance and lack of capital return. I think they would benefit greatly from capital return and increase shareholder sentiment however I have complete faith in their fundamentals so this doesn't deter me personally.",

They lag in AI and this will show increasingly in their cloud growth going forward as Microsoft dials up AI backed product line up and take more market share from AWS.

                "comment_body": "I think it is important to have a 50,000 view of what happened at Amazon over the last five years:\n\nAt the end of 2018, Amazon had just finished an incredible run.  They were a hundred dollar stock, and had been on an upward rocket for the last 4 years, and the stock price increased by 600%.  Because of this growth, they were being rewarded with a PE over 100.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the entire market was hit.  The SP500 took a hit, but Amazon went down 10% more than the market. What was happening is that Amazon was going through a PE reset. While in the past, they had over 100 PE, suddenly they were in the 70-80.  It not that Amazon looked dead in the water, but Mr. Market said that they didn't deserve the three digit PE.\n\nAs a result, through the next year, they didn't recover like the SP500.  However, the company was still making good progress.\n\nThis changed of course during Covid.  Everybody was locked at home, and Amazon couldn't ship enough, fast enough, and didn't have enough capacity.\n\nAt this point in time, they had a choice:\n\na. Covid wasn't a fad, shelter at home would take a long time to recover, and life had changed forever.  This was a once in a life time chance to ramp Capex and put in the facilities to change Amazon forever.\n\nb. Covid would quickly get out a shot, people would respond well, and start shopping in stores again, and they should be careful about Capex.\n\nIf I was Amazon, I would have said \"it take two years to get a distribution center going, we are going big.  This is a once in a life time opportunity.\"  I applaud their guts.\n\nThe FDA approved the first vaccine August '21, while Amazon was just about to $3 earnings per share, which was a record.  \n\nHowever, the writing was on the wall.  They had simply overbuilt, and all signs were starting to point to the idea that the demand would not fill their warehouses.  They had put in too much Capex and too much opex for demand that would never happen.\n\nBy C2Q22, you didn't need to tell Wall Street they had an issue, because their EPS was cut in half.  They started to clean up their books, and tried to figure out what to do with the assets.\n\nBy November of 22, just a little over a year after the vaccine, Amazon started their largest layoff ever.  The went into the process of unwinding the big gamble.  In stereotypical Amazon fashion, they slashed and burned with the goal to make it quick.  \n\nBy the first part of 23, they were through the layoffs, the miserable quarters of earnings, and a punishing fall in their stock price.  However, the pain looked over.  Since this low point, they have doubled their stock price even after yesterday's event.\n\nFor me, I don't see a company that made a bad decision.  It was a calculated risk decision that was the wrong one in 20/20 hindsight.  Once the bad decision was created, they moved much faster than most companies in trying to restructure.\n\nTo me, the biggest questions are:\n\na. Did something happen at the end of 2022 through all the changes that somehow lost the Amazon secret?  I don't see this.\n\nb. Is there some \"big risk\" that amazon is taking similar to the capital ramp during Covid that would cause me to say \"well here they go again.  Amazon is taking a bit risk and will fail again.\"  I don't see this.\n\nYesterday, I see a stock that Mr. Market wanted to rotate out of to free up money to put into other sectors.",

GCP will probably only be half the size of AWS and Azure by 2028.\n\nI am going to oversimplify some stuff on Ai.\n\n1.  The vast majority of AI programmers access through Python libraries.\n2.  For the most part, life becomes simple if your Python libraries talk to nVidia chips.\n3. You need to have nVidia in your data center, and the vast majority of the load load is though a common library going to a common nVidia Cuda layer.\n\nHowever, we do have people like Google trying to do an end around and put in their own Tensor AI chip, but this is just in the beginning stages.\n\nSo, at the highest, most over simplified level, all cloud guys have the same libraries running on nVidia hardware.  The problem is this has massive business implications.\n\nThe Cloud guys are buying now based on potential, and the stakes are enormous due to Capex requirements:  \n\nData Center 2020 Sales:\n\n* Intel about $30B\n* AMD about $1.5B\n* nVidia about $7B\n\nProject 2024 (this year)\n\n* Intel about $20B\n* AMD about $13B\n* nVidia about $100B",

There's really not a clear leader for the cloud AI market.](https://www.bdccglobal.com/blog/aws-ai-or-azure-ai-which-cloud-service-is-better/)  Both companies have been fighting each other for years, and they both get to similar results because they cover each other moves.  While there could be some magic move that develops in the future, we have no sign of one competitor clearly pulling ahead today.\n\nHowever, this is where your investment choices need to be watched.  One could pull ahead of the other, but it won't happen quick.  You don't need to be an AI expert, but having some understanding of Tensors, Tensorflow/PyTorch, nVidia Cuda vs TPU, etc are critical to watch and understand if somebody is pulling ahead tomorrow.\n\nThe cloud changes in share is very dependent on each companies CapEx strategy.  If we rewind the clock to 2020, MSFT had deep pockets, a legacy software franchise that generated cash, and a \"modest\" cloud capex budget of $17B or about 1/3 of their FCF.  \n\nFast forward to 2024, MSFT will need to invest around $50B in cloud capex.  While they will make around $75B in free cash flow their \n dividend will remove $20B out of this.  They basically need to invest all of their cash flow into the cloud.  The cloud is a Capex business, and therefore MSFT won't be able to finance from operations, and need to go further into debt.\n\nAmazon is in the opposite issue.  With their \"bad choice\" from Covid, they had to take on debt to continue their cloud expansion.  However, it actually turns out that the retail side of Amazon is a cash machine.  The fact that they don't pay a dividend is a massive help so that cash flow will be much better than MSFT by next year.  \n\nNow, they do have more debt than MSFT, so you have two ships passing in the night.  One that is increasing debt (MSFT) and one that is trying to get rid of their debt (Amazon).  On top of this, Amazon has to feed the retail capex needs also, so they have more balls to juggle.\n\nHowever, given just \"turning the crank\" for Amazon retail, by the time Azure catches AWS, AWS will probably have more cash flexibility to feed the machine.  MSFT can take on debt, but they will do it cautiously.\n\nNet-net:  I'm saying they will be Coke and Pepsi.  Neither will have a big enough CapEx budget to hurt the other without damaging both themselves and the industry.",

Grove was the mastermind of this, and as soon as Intel put in non-technical people in leadership, their days were numbered.  Intel fell when they didn't make the jump to 10nm.  The mess that Pat is trying to solve today stems from a decision by Krzanich.\n\nMy main concern is the whole semiconductor industry is set up on a house of cards of outsourcing.  I love nVidia's IP.  I love Lisa's wheeling and dealing.  I hate the idea that if TSMC has an issue they are screwed beyond belief.  And I'm not saying \"oh be worried if China invades Taiwan.\"\n\nTaiwan is on an earthquake zone.  \n\nI guess of everybody, ignoring the boom bust, I love ASML.  What they do with EUV is absolute science fiction.  Yet, even here, China is being held at gun point, so China is going to figure out how to ramp a path to get it up and going.\n\nIf you are willing to simply take risk, and not worry about a black swam, I think the long term answers are obvious:  ASML, nVidia, and TSMC.  Diversify into all three, and get out when you see the boom bust cycle start.\n\nBut I can't emphasize enough the fact that TSMC is an incredible liability.\n\nIf for any reason, Taiwan saw a serious earthquake, Intel would go from everybody's favorite \"who was the idiot that invested into this company?\" To \"well Intel was the only company that had an intelligent fab strategy.\"",

Street expectation was 158,422 @ 9.8% = $15.455.  The revenue is 1% off, with the profit being around 15% off to the current street.  Amazon historically out performs their guide in C3Q.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see C3Q margin reduced due to prime day.\n\nOn the earnings call, Jassy called out that 3Q margins would be impacted by prime day, ramping expenses for 4Q, Kuiper, and digital content.  The first one can be thought of as running prime day as the US economy cools.  You don't expect a great prime day if people are nervous about spending.   The last three can be thought of as investments, and if you raise your expense, but generate ROI, most investors take this trade off.  So, the margin is acceptable.\n\nThe revenue guide from C2Q to C3Q is well within the normal C2Q to C3Q increase, and has been present for something like 19 out of the last 20 years.\n\nI'm not overly happy with the 20% year to year increases in advertising revenue when compared to Meta, but Amazon ads are very different than Meta ads.  I'm not sure you can drive higher ads if you 3rd party market is feeling shaky.  I'm not sure that I feel at that great about Kuiper.",

Meta going from $400 to $100 and back to $400 in a short span is a great example.\n\nI\u2019m an AI engineer with an electrical engineering background, so I have a bit of understanding into what Intel does. I know CUDA gives NVIDIA a huge moat, and Intel\u2019s fab/CPU business\u2014its core business\u2014has often faced delays. These delays have given AMD a chance to catch up, especially with their use of TSMC\u2019s advanced manufacturing nodes. Meanwhile, Intel is trying to catch up in the AI space with OpenCL, an open-source competitor to CUDA, and oneAPI, which aims to provide a unified programming model across different hardware. But it seems like getting developers to move away from NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem is challenging.\n\nI\u2019d love to have a fact-driven, in-depth discussion about where Intel stands in the chip business, especially considering AMD, TSMC, and NVIDIA. Does Intel have any deep moat today, and where are they bleeding? Are Intel\u2019s investments in AI (acquiring Habana Labs, investing in AI accelerators like Intel Nervana) worthwhile to regain their competitive edge, or is their x86 dominance fading with ARM and RISC-V on the rise?

Design was inefficient because could run many revisions and rush respins and use many process steps without paying for it: compare to AMD who have to pay TSM for every bit of work. Fab was inefficient because could only make leading edge chips, when a process or tool became lagging edge INTC had no further use for it: compare to TSM who makes everything from leading to lagging edge, the latter with fully amortized tools.  INTC also chose to not adopt EUV, which was a mistake.\n2. INTC also relied on high clock speed and did not adopt high core count as quickly as AMD did.  Possibly because it did not anticipate the increase in multi-threaded workloads, possibly simply another mistake.\n3. INTC did not want to dilute its x86 high margins and high volumes, so passed on business that turned out to be valuable, example being mobile processors.  \n4. INTC did not have a strong GPU business.  But GPUs have become central for compute, not just gaming, and INTC was late to the party.\n5. Became led by accountants not engineers, got fat and overstaffed.  Like BA.\n\n- What is INTC doing to right the ship?\n1.  Accelerating node progression to catch up to TSM.  Latest INTC nodes are almost caught up, next one will be.  But it takes time and costs a lot.\n2. Using TSM as its foundry, as stop gap measure until INTC\u2019s own advanced nodes are ready.  This also costs a lot.\n3. Adopting EUV even more aggressively than TSM.  Also costs a lot.\n4.  Pushing hard on GPUs for compute/AI - Gaudi is basically that.   Also costs a lot.\n5.  Cutting fat (heads), changing leadership, bringing in outside capital (governments, partners), cutting costs (dividend). \n6.  Separating design from fab, forcing design to stand on its own and be efficient, forcing fab to do the same.  Building a foundry business to get the volume required for leading edge scale and, eventually, the lagging edge business to use amortized tools.  Costs a . . . you get the idea.\n\n- Why is it so hard?\n1.  The list of things that need fixing is long - from leadership to culture, basic business strategy and structure, and technological challenges of getting to leading edge processes\n2.  We\u2019ve been in a downcycle for PC and server demand, partly post-pandemic hangover, partly AI sucking up the corporate spending.  You see this in AMD, MU, others.  \n\n- Will INTC succeed?\n1. I think yes, in part because having US controlled and located leading edge semiconductor design and fab is now a national security priority.  Like BA, INTC is too critical to be allowed to fail.\n2.  Doesn\u2019t mean shareholders will necessarily win.  Look at other too big to fails: FNM FRE C GM.  But ultimately semiconductors are such a high margin business that I think odds are if one\u2019s cost basis is low enough, there will be good money made - eventually.",

                "comment_body": "My background is chip design.\n\nIntel moat is that it has design around legacy architecture. People just want shit to work without having to debug anything. Lots of support from legacy software. It's a lot of work to port software to arm or even risc v. Many companies don't want to invest resources into do it. It's a lot of work to rebuild a software from the ground up to work on a different architecture. \n\nAlso there is no real architecture advantages of arm over x86. There have numerous studies on it. The cost of having a decoder is minimal. The power and perf benefit relies on the design and how efficient cache and memory are managed. It just so happens that arm focus has been around low power mobile devices while x86 was built for desktops.\n\nFoundry wise it's more complicated. His high capital investment and any error means you lose your advantage. The only advantage here is that Intel is an American company and will get bailed out and supported like boeing despite many failures. Tsmc can only fail so much, the capital support from Taiwan is limited. \n\nOwning a foundry can benefit Intel over amd if the foundry is as competitive as tsmc or Samsung. Owning your own fab means you get higher margins from any chip you produce out of it and you don't need to pay a premium for production cost with Qualcomm, Nvidia, Amd etc.. If tsmc were to raise their prices or some accident happens your entire supply cost just went up.\n\nPat gelsinger was smart in turning Intel foundry into a business where anyone can fab from. Now they can justify their investment and maybe get some additional revenue from other companies using their fabs. 2027 is the year to see if all the investment and strategy will pay off. Everything from now til then will be hard. Expect a difficult road.",

                "comment_body": "In my view as someone who works in the field,   \n\nFirst we have to look at the Intel and AMD as personal electronics businesses. In personal electronics, speed and scale is the name of the game. The data center business also has a PE-like behaviour. With almost yearly releases of chips, they have to design and build chips at breakneck speeds. At one point in the GPU wars, NVIDIA is able to release twice in a year.\n\nFab and fabless models are relevant here. With fabless, AMD is able to leverage the scale that TSMC brings without the significant technology and capital risks that semis manufacturing brings, and TSMC being a fab services company, can happily scale up knowing that demand is high and repeatable from diverse fabless companies, without the commercial / design risk. In summary the fabless ecosystem brings down risks. This is advantageous in personal electronics because of its market cycle. I can almost guarantee that with the speed and competitive pressure of PE, screw ups are an expectation; but with the fabless model this risk is shared.\n\nIntel being an integrated fab company, they do not have this advantage. This is the structural disadvatange of Intel. \n\nIn leading edge semiconductors however, manufacturing is a winner-takes-all business. Once you get the speed, scale and cost, you win. The issue with the fabless ecosystem is that only TSMC and maybe Samsung can take on the latest nodes. If they miss a manufacturing technology cycle, everyone will come crawling back to Intel and AMD will be in the dust. Fabless companies will be screwed. This is why back then Intel holds almost a monopolistic position in the leading edge and AMD was known for cheaper less performant chips. This is the structural advantage of Intel.\n\nManufacturing is hard. Leading edge semis manufacturing is a long term, high capital, high risk business. This is why only 2 maybe 3 companies in the world can deliver leading nodes at scale and cost. It has commercial-aircraft-like barriers to entry. The manufacturing technology cycle for leading edge nodes can span decades. Intel has missed one and paid the price.\n\nNow what is the likelyhood that Intel brings back their manufacturing? They have the capital and existing knowledge. Now it is all up to skillfull management and engineers to make it work. People like to shit on MBA/accountant types but TSMC being able to deliver what they can now is in no small part due to skillfull financial management that has the patience and deep understanding of the business. \n\nAs a disclosure, I hold both intel and tsmc stocks, but I view intel with a (much) higher idiosyncratic risk. I dont hold AMD.",

Ironically, the fab side has more of a tech moat (partially due to sheer complexity & capital intensity) - yet TSMC has the edge over Intel, while Intel's better retained its competitive advantages on the design side (and marketing & distribution) over AMD for now. \n\n* **Brand recognition & ecosystem relationships**: though AMD has been gaining since the release of Zen. Specter & Meltdown hurt a lot; e.g., on the server side it went from a 99-1 to more of a 70-30 split.\n* **Vertical integration**: double-edged sword - makes intra-generation advancement across nodes easier & more predictable, but disincentivizes inter-generation (e.g., from DUV to EUV) due to the capital requirement \n* **Patent portfolio:** though existing competitors also have their own, it does form a moat vs potential new entrants; similarly for all existing capabilities, assets etc. - the capital intensity forms a moat against virtually anyone not named TSMC\n\nOther dynamics:\n\n* **Pro - Bonus moat**: the government is likely to prefer Intel's foundry over TSMC or Samsung, so e.g., more CHIPS funding and government contracts are possible (just noticed someone else's already mentioned this)\n* **Con - Conflict of interest**: TSMC will almost always have the advantage that fabless players won't see it as a potential competitor\n* **Con - Move to GPUs & ASICS**: there appears to be this fundamental shift in the profit pools away from PC CPUs to mobile SOCs, GPUs, and other AI accelerators.

The only competitors to Nvidia's business were optimized inference chips from AWS and TPU from GCP, but Nvidia is taking battle to these cloud providers grounds by supporting GPU cloud startups and offering its on DGX cloud (essentially making cloud providers a commodity).  \n2. Compete in GPUs fab business (if IFS takes off).  \n3. Maintaining it's current market share on server side CPUs.  \n4. Maintaining a duopoly with AMD on personal compute CPUs.  \n5.

INTC has packaging and power, design library, and in a couple years will have truly leading edge prices at scale.  But it will take time, like a few years, for profit and cash flow to ramp to significant levels.  \n\nOn AI, my view is that the mass rush by everyone to train ever-larger models requiring ever-larger GPU resources, will run out in a couple years.  There will be enough highly capable LLMs, most users will be better off adapting others\u2019 LLMs than building their own, better models will reduce the compute intensity, and the money will run out for most new entrants to the LLM building game.\n\nIn the long term, the bulk of the AI workload has to shift to inference, because that\u2019s what does the economically productive work.  Training is basically capex to build the infrastructure: eventually infrastructure has to start generating revenue and profit.\n\nInference has to become far, far less compute intensive - than training, and than current inference.  Inference is operating expense, and opex has to be low enough relative to revenue to produce profit.  How much revenue will a company get from generating one AI response  - $0.01?  Inference will have to cost some fraction of that - $0.004?  Maybe less, I don\u2019t know.  \n\nSo I think 1) inference in the cloud will need the lowest possible cost, more than it will need the highest performance or highest speed, and 2) companies will push inference to the end user\u2019s device (phone, PC, corporate user\u2019s on-premises systems) because most of those compute resources are sitting idle most of the time.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if 1) is an opportunity for Gaudi and other non-NVDA GPUs, although AMD seems to making progress, but I think 2) is an opportunity for CPUs of all sorts - including INTC.\n\n\u201cAI PC\u201d and \u201cAI phone\u201d are clearly 2025 things at best, but the winners there will be different than the winners in today\u2019s training race.",

In the long term, Intel\u2019s prospects hinge on several factors despite the current layoffs of like 15%\u2026\n\nRestructuring and layoffs usually do indicate a strategic shift to streamline operations and focus on core strengths. Intel\u2019s investment in new manufacturing technologies and fabs, including plans to regain process node leadership, could enhance its competitive edge. AMD and NVIDIA obviously are dominating right now, but continued strong demand for semiconductors across various sectors, including data centers, cloud computing etc can drive long-term growth.\n\nAlso, Intel\u2019s expansion efforts, including new fabs in the U.S. and Europe, might mitigate risks associated with global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

For an EV of $1Tn (current brk price) that\u2019s 18x earnings, +/-.  Pricey for a slow grower, but BRK is a financial fortress.\n\nThere is no guarantee on what BRK will do with that much cash equivalents.  They might hold onto it for a decade, getting 0% real return on 25% of the company (and 7% on the rest).  If we hit a major crisis, they may deploy it or they may not (they sold airline stocks at a major loss and didn\u2019t deploy capital in pandemic panic of 2020).\n\nThe market could decide they don\u2019t like the stock, as it did a few years ago.  Buffet will die, and his replacements may not find ways to deploy that much capital for a good return.\n\nYou can\u2019t really compare a hysa to equity.  One is a highly liquid safe as houses place to park cash and maintain real value.  Any equity is a bet on the people running the place, and at any given time what you can get for it is subject to current market pricing.\n\nIf none of this is tracking then go over to the bogleheads and learn about asset class allocation based upon your liquidity needs.",

Spun out of Baxter in 2003 and has a proven track record of spectacular earnings power.\n\nThis was a hot ride until it got rerated, starting about 2021ish (PE 50's to low 20's now). Structural heart repair is not a cyclical industry where an initially low PE skyrockets with unfavorable moves in E (followed by a downward trend in P). The business has continued growing nicely with very little leverage employed. Markets have simply rerated the entire industry.\n\nHistorically, Edwards has only made two $300m+ acquisitions and a handful under $100m. Most of their growth has been organic ($37B market cap now). CEO since the spin (Mussalem) has stepped down. Already, the new guy is selling off a $4B division (Critical Care, monitoring equipment) and made 2 big acquisitions for around $2B, one of which I like, [JenaValve](https://jenavalve.com) for percutaneous (that means through a catheter) repair of aortic regurgitation (1st mover). The other acquisition is [Endotronix](https://endotronix.com) a non-invasive medical grade sensor to monitor for heart failure (HF). **M*****anagement says*** they expect CE approval in 2025 which almost always presages commercialization in the USA. There are currently no non-invasive medical grade solutions. Abbott has a popular invasive monitoring solution with their [CardiMems](https://www.cardiovascular.abbott/us/en/hcp/products/heart-failure/pulmonary-pressure-monitors/cardiomems/about.html) product. I heartily encourage medical professionals to call me out on anything here.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer they not sell Critical Care and instead, use a little debt for acquisitions. They're selling a growing monitoring business that undoubtedly gathers a lot of data (I hear AI is a thing now) and buying another unproven monitoring business. I don't think it will kill the core business but it does look kind of stupid. What do I know?\n\nThese guys (EW, Medtronic, Abbott, more) have all been fighting each other over patent infringements for a long time and I think we may see consolidation. The industry (TAVR) has come a long way, really fast. Everybody's got a heart.\n\nIf you're interested, start watching [lectures / procedures on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=transcatheter+heart+valve+replacement) (fascinating stuff).\n\nI've owned EW since 2012 and have sold a lot of shares over the years (right up to when it started re-rating => luck) it's dropped hard recently and I've been adding to bring the position back up to 10%ish. My cost basis was $6 a share before I added, and it's $31 now. I'm a mostly LT guy who will trim a position and then add back at favorable prices. I also hold a 2% position in Abbott.\n\nDYODD\n\nBuy in haste, repent at leisure.",

Yet I, and millions of others, spend hundreds or more with them weekly. With a PE of around 57, which is really high for a retailer, even with a membership model imo, it\u2019s been tough to get involved. Yet the stock price marches higher.\n\nYesterday I was considering starting a cash secured put strategy on it to generate some income and buy it lower if it ever dips. Even with today\u2019s crap jobs report and slowing economy, we\u2019re still not near a recession, which when it occurs, would make COST dive a little if the market thought members will pull back on spending. It\u2019s up another 1/2% as I write this in a terrible market session.\n\nThe new policy COST is rolling out to scan cards at the entrance will be their Netflix moment. It\u2019ll drive a lot of new membership revenue growth which is really their secret sauce. The stock is only going higher from here I bet. \n\nbtw the $725 Sept 20 CSP is paying $450 and if it drops that far by 9/20 I\u2019d be on the hook for $72.5k of COST stock. Probably a good bet. Kind of like walking down the sidewalk and finding an envelope stuffed with a little cash. Currently only a 12% chance it hits $725 and less chance it\u2019s there at close of biz on 9/20. Plus it\u2019s an election year with Sept interest rate cut pending so it\u2019ll never hit $725 in 6 weeks. (Famous last words).",

Now lets deconstruct your argument.\n\n1) Active Accounts: Paypal has gained 3M new accounts in the last two quarters. Now with Fastlane rolling out with 80% conversion rate things should improve ideally from here as reducing number of clicks in payment process is essential to improve user experience.\n\n2) Low PE: PE is an essential factor to understand whether the company is trading at a discount or not. Markets can be wrong more times than you think as we have seen with Meta or Netflix back in 2021/22. Please be my guest and buy companies like AMD that are trading at 150x PE.\n\n3) 80% fall from highs: Market was in euphoria back in 2021 due to which everything was valued at absurd price. Paypal was never a good bet at 300 but certainly is at 60 with less o/s shares, increasing revenues and all the factors mentioned above.\n\n4) Management team: A company is made by the people who work for it not the other way around. Look at Alex Chris history at Intuit and what he did in the SMB vertical there. This is where Paypal has the biggest opportunity and thats why the board has hired him. Paypal was woke under the old leadership but company is now swiftly moving away from such political propagandas. He has done more for the company in less than a year compared to Dan Schulman who was constantly putting pressure on take rates hence transaction margins have already started to improve. \n\n5) Crypto: Again, please check the net income generated by Tether in the first six months of this year. It\u2019s close to $6B. Yes, this is net income not revenues. With 430M active accounts in their umbrella Paypal has a huge opportunity to leverage the true potential of stablecoin. The market cap of PYUSD has already doubled since they introduced it for cross-border transactions.\n\n6. Buybacks: Buybacks are not productive? Dumbest statement ever. It might be true for a declining company but Paypal is not declining since their revenues are going in only one direction - up. Check what buybacks did to Autozone - since 1998 they were able to buyback 90% of the company and the stock price has gone up by 40,000%. Yes, 40,000%. Paypal is a FCF generating machine with close to $6B this year and all are going into buybacks.\n\nStop confusing a bad company with bad stock price. These are two different things. \n\nAsk. Dont judge.",

They're losing money and have a lot of competitive pressures, but the CEO (Pat Gelsinger) is turning it around and has been doing a lot of cost cutting and aggressive R&D. They're not at risk of bankruptcy, but I don't know if they'll be profitable over the long-term. Looking at his track record at VMWare, the company he was at before intel, he did okay. Earnings grew at about market rate.\n\nIf you had held from 3 years after he took over power to the sale of the company 2 years after he stepped down as CEO, it annualized about 13.3% (ballpark estimate +/-3%). \n\nThe company is flat YoY, and they've spent quite a bit on restructuring and R&D, and it looks like they're amidst a turnaround play. I think it's getting overslammed due to sentiment surrounding semiconductors in general. There are a lot of risks in INTC but nothing that would completely destroy the company. At the end of the day it's still an S&P 500 component and a major player in the semiconductor space with 76% market share, and a likely beneficiary of US gov't AI funding with the only real competitors being TSM/AMD which are now \"Americanizing\" too.\n\nSo my analysis is: the company is not an obvious long. I was expecting the foundry unit to turn around faster, but it looks like it may be a permanent change to the fundamentals of the company. I'm going to keep an eye open for an entry because I think the upside risk is greater than the downside risk and will be looking to exit if the market gives me a large pop.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed to the company that would justify the drop from \\~$30/share to \\~$22/share.

Any value stock that doesn't work out becomes a value trap. \n2-3 years ago Intel had several (potential) tailwinds (CHIPS act, secular industry growth, unmet demand, high market share in some segments). I used to own it and I eventually gave up on it, took a loss, but could've lost MUCH more.\nIt wasn't a clear value trap to me. It's a legacy business that failed to execute on several sides, lost market share, and continuously fucked up. I follow a lot of PC gaming hardware news and there were many red flags, including: releasing a new Gen with absolutely 0 improvements (gen 13th to 14th) and having essentially a broken unfixable problem (known since at least 6 months). The second turned into class action and so on. \n\nThe only lesson here is don't put all your eggs in one basket and be clear on what you expect and what makes \"good\" a good company from a qualitative point of view (not only stats and numbers)",

Together with AMD and almost all other big companies are pushing for open standards in AI, that everyone in industry wants, thus again going for Nvidia. \n\nCash position at end of last year was \\~7B. End of June was 11.2B. They are in the process of reorganizing and better position themselves for exponential growth in future. If you want to compete with TSMC you have to invest BIG in new factories and so they did. But this obviously eats up from profits and cash. If you look at net assets, you see that those increased and for the first time probably in decades, net assets is about 120B while market cap is 90B. CPUs are competitive, AI segment will soon be, they have a large amount of fabs with various nodes and what everyone seems to ignore is that they booked all High NA EUV machines from ASML for 2024. When looking at TSMC, it's about 9 times more valuable yet it has about the same value of net assets. \n\nAverage old investor only knows that Intel never rises and disappoints during earnings. But average old investor is not able to imagine the new Intel that Pat is aiming for. Nor does wallstreet. Hint: study AMD in period 2013-2017.\n\nFor what it's actually worth as potential, Intel is now dangerously cheap for an acquisition.",

I know that Intel will not be in good position until Arrow Lake arrives and even then they might just achieve parity with AMD. I know that this year they will incur massive losses due to their fab investment and it will take two more years until their investment starts to pay off.\n\nIf you are FOMO investor, you should had went with Nvidia or AMD instead. Intel is for value investors and with it comes its own set of challenges. One is having emotional maturity to weather short term price fluctuations. Another is understanding issues company is facing and believing that they can turn business around. It is about investing in businesses which were not yet recognized and accounted for by the stock market or one which is being dismissed and under-valued by a stock market.\n\nIntel as a company might be losing its edge, but even then its price is far below what those flagship companies should command. It already had suffered worst of its issues and drop in stock price. I believe it is a good price point to get investing into this stock.\n\nIntel also has massive upswings. Now every investor and their dog overvalues TSMC. Yes, that was a perfect value stock before. However, now it is running on FOMO and hype alone. If anything starts happening near Taiwan then its entire market will come crumbling down. At the same time, dependance on in-house cutting edge manufacturing will see a dramatic boom. Like, one USA government is doing with Intel. Local chip manufacturing will become the next big thing. So, this is one risk/benefit of an Intel stock.\n\nYou also have to follow their products. I'm recommending this stock on a credit that their future architectures will catch up to AMD and will outcompete it. I do have high hopes for Intel, because their microchip architecture was always superior to AMD's. They were competing with 1-2 node disadvantage. Their processors have a lot of inherent advantages over AMD like strong single core performance which yields better to gaming and server tasks. Yes, they are being beaten decisively in every front by AMD, but investing was never research-light task. Follow their next generation processors. See if company's new product is turning things around. If they do then stock price will inevitably go up again.\n\nBtw: what gives me hope is that Gelsinger is succeeding as CEO. He successfully managed to push Intel's goals on time. A company which can keep its technical milestones on track is something which I value and gives me hope about company's future.",

Often have had this discussion with family and friends and often trying but failing to convince them to invest in what they know.\n\nTbf though, if you spend that much time on the business, write many pages of DDs and forced yourself to model it all out you'd probably know the business better than most employees.\n\nIt might be surprising but saw firsthand for multiple companies how occasionally even the CFO had a loose understanding of figures, while at other companies, even the CEO lacked a holistic sense of the unit economics (the COO had a better idea but still not the full picture - the cost allocation was all over the place). \n\nThen there were the firms where many in the C-suite were not business-minded. They could manage large teams & huge complexity to get work delivered, but didn't know who their major competitors were (or who future customers might be), let alone any clue of future sales, strategy roadmaps and how the sector might trend.\n\nOf course there are also extremely well-informed management teams, but don't underestimate the edge that careful study can sometimes give you, especially for niche sectors, small caps and less favored markets.\n\nI try to go deep enough that there's a good chance of an informational edge and also model it out, e.g.: https://www.alphaexponent.net/p/2-feb-11-24-plover-bay",

Good luck and I hope it works out for you but recovery is going to take awhile and during that period you won\u2019t even get to collect or reinvest the dividend. \n\nA LOT of people and institutions held Intel because of its dividend. They are no longer holding Intel. \n\nWhen I FIRE\u2019d at 54 years old a few years back, I chose a path of DGI , which stands for Dividend Growth Investing. I wanted to live off a steady stream of growing dividends (8-10% dividend growth per year on average across our portfolio) versus selling shares to fund our lifestyle. There are certainly Pro\u2019s/Con\u2019s to it and there are a lot of different ways to make money but it works really well for us. \n\nA key tenet to DGI is that Dividend payers (aside from REITS, MLP\u2019s, etc.) who pay out a ratio higher than 70% of their adjusted earnings to fund their dividend are risky. Intel crossed that bar back in 2022 when their payout ratio hit 79.35%. \n\nI saw that their earnings were slowing and their dividend was in jeopardy years ago, which is why I sold INTC at $46 on 11/6/20 and added more MSFT, which grows their dividend 10%/yr and has an adjusted payout ratio of only 23%.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MSsyYwB",

The extent of the shift to GPUs might have come as a surprise, but folks paying attention to HPC would've gotten some hints from Jaguar (ironically using AMD Opterons) being overtaken by a GPU-driven cluster (and all the top supercomputers thereafter to use GPUs).\n\nCrypto bros might also have noticed the shift ahead of time, and similarly for deep learning enthusiasts.\n\nOf course it doesn't go against your observation that it'll be virtually impossible to quantify the precise potential impact years ahead of time (and overprecise DCFs would just instill false confidence), but a qualitative understanding or even educated guess as to the trend is maybe more doable.",

AMD had really only 1 competitor to really focus on:  Intel, and Intel was kind enough to get complacent and milk their processor designs giving AMD a window of opportunity.\n\nToday, Intel's situation may seem similar, but it is not.  Intel faces multiple competitors in multiple markets (CPUs it has AMD, but also potentially Qualcomm now and many other ARM vendors).  Fabrication it has TSMC and Samsung.  It is very unlikely AMD or TSMC are going to give Intel the window of opportunity Intel gave AMD.  Intel is going to have to really pull it together to get back in the mix.  If their 18A node pans out, they have a real chance.  But, how long will the 18A node be relevant for?  Will they be able to keep up the competition?\n\nI think INTC isn't going anywhere, the US gov't won't allow it to.  But I also don't think they're going to have an AMD moment.  As for the stock, I agree with others that its probably not a long term value play.  But that doesn't mean it can't be a good investment (at the right price).",

When the German plant comes online there will be nothing better.\n\nWhy the stock is down 25% I have no idea - everyone already knows their chip business is dying. The only things of note are the layoffs and the removal of the dividend. Both are positives.\n\nAs with many things, looks ugly on paper but deep down is good news. \n\nPat is aiming for the stars but hes always underselling himself. What happens in the next few years may be more of the same, but once the fab business starts rolling in, then you will see a fundamental shift in the way Jntel operates. Plus, when Taiwan gets their ass invaded, TSMC will be no more. At that point, Intel could be a trillion dollar company.",

It\u2019s a super tough call and hard to swallow, but I genuinely don\u2019t think Intel recovers in the long term.\n\nI used to be an Intel bull, but got burned and now I\u2019m very very bearish on the company.\n\n[I posted about a some Intel news four years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/Fy92aNyQm9) sharing that Intel was starting to face some major issues. Their chips were no longer best in class and they had supply chain issues.\n\n\n[Four years ago I commented to a Rate My Portfolio thread over in /r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/8QhMFuhS6e) that I had been invested in Intel for almost 2.5 years at the time, and had planned to own for the long term. At the time of that comment, I was up 30% in unrealized gains and was concerned that the stock dropping to $52 would cut my gains in half. If only I left it there.\n\n[A year or so later I was worried that my unrealized gains were down to +3%](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/9mrK5kmZXC). It\u2019s unclear when I sold it all completely, but I know for sure that I did not make any money. I understand that 3-4 years is not long term, but the company seemed to have issue after issue and simply never had a good moment since.\n\nI reference these posts/comments not to say \u201cyou were warned\u201d or anything like that, but to illustrate the fundamental issues the company has faced for years and to provide tangible examples of seeing the negative press unfold on Reddit over time.\n\nThe sentiment on /r/stocks back in the day, well before /r/ValueInvesting had picked up, was to focus on blue chip stocks at good values. I remember $INTC being a community favorite and people used to say \u201cit\u2019ll be around forever\u201d. The subs have changed in that time, and so has the thesis on Intel. It\u2019s in the strongest industry snd had a crazy head start on the competition, just to squander it all and drive itself into the ground. \n\nI want to say I was in your shoes, but my total investment was probably only 5% of yours. It was pennies in the earlier days of my investing interests and activities. So I really feel for you. But all I can say is sometimes you\u2019ve just got to realize that a company is done for and cut your losses.",

They do cost reduction and finally question everything. Note that big companies are full of leeches (aka intermediary management) that bleed money so there is always room to do cost cutting. If you keep, you may see the price going down even more followed by a slow rebounce and then yearly growth, possibly reaching new all time highs (see AMD restructuring from last decade). If you sell, you should have a good alternative that has the same potential long term with better risk reward ratio. \n\nNot a financial advice.",

They've also been plagued with problems shrinking their dye, are a generation behind competitors in CPU design, their fabs are so bad that they use TSMC rather than their own, and their GPU is about as bad as would be expected given their new competitors in the space.\n\nThey're trying to build new fab facilities and have already given up on the one in Israel. They missed earnings despite in recent years decreasing dividends by 2/3 and c-suite salaries across the board. They pay below industry standard but have managed to attract talent thanks to their perks, but have now cut the perks. Their current employee count is \\~130,000 while AMD is \\~25,000. This means that they are a significantly less mobile company despite having a market cap of less than half of AMD.  They also just found out that their 13th/14th-generation chips are degraded and slated for early failure. They are blaming it on voltage from motherboard manufacturers setting it too high, but likely are trying to save time to figure out the actual issue. Keep in mind lowering the voltage will increase the lead AMD has on value atm. They've offered an extended warranty of 3 years (which is a very short shelf life for a CPU) but there is a mounting class-action law suit that could hurt them badly (though it is unlikely to).\n\nThe current CEO has placed multiple aggressive timelines that would be great if they managed to hit them. Unfortunately they haven't.\n\nThe current upsides are that they're early adopters in a different type of EUV which allows for more advanced chip design (which will be helpful in 3 years at the earliest), they're growing a market in cars, and they're in a place to profit if Taiwan sees political instability. The last addendum is becoming increasingly minimal as TSMC builds more plants in USA, Japan, and Korea.\n\nThe biggest issue is employee culture. Intel attracts the midwits who care enough to keep their job. If it was a company of talented individuals that had promising futures I would be way more comfortable betting on them, but given their market cap is currently lower than their assets' valuation you can imagine what Wall Street thinks of Intel as an organization. \n\nThey are the only chip manufacturer/designer that has below COVID levels of market cap, and there is good reason for it.

This is because they saw larger than expected shipments for those chips. This decreased their margins but allows them to already scale up the Ireland Fab. So what they essentially did is they hurt their short term Margins on the Product side to benefit the foundry side in the long term.\n\nIf anyone invested because of their turnaround in the foundry business, this is absolutely good news and a good decision.\n\nI think the market reaction is a little to harsh as well, but it's exacerbated by the general market correction that is especially hard on chip stocks. Arm was down 15% and nvidia 6% before intel earnings. So sentiment was already horrible.\n\nNow all the analysts downgrading doesn't help either, but those are the same analysts that gave Netflix a sell rating when it was in a similar situation, in which it missed previously lowered guidance, and started cutting costs back in 2022.\n\n>Plus, when Taiwan gets their ass invaded, TSMC will be no more\n\nThis seems very unlikely to me.

        "post_date": "2024-08-02T16:02:00",
        "post_body": "\nA. Think of Mr. Market as someone who comes to your door and offers to sell you his wares at a discount.\n\nYou can choose to buy from him at a discount or not. What you should not do is to sell your wares back  to him at a discount. \n\nB. Our human instinct of fight or flight is the opposite of what to do in a volatile market. Sometimes it is better to just stay put and do nothing.\n\nC. Here is what I did today:\n\nSaw the market was choppy. Went to check, the biggest swooners were Amazon at -12% and GE at -6%. CMG was -3% \n\nWent to check if the bad news was company specific, or market related. (Amazon retail nos was bad but aws was good and I bought in 2016/2017 because of cloud computing. Larry Culp didn\u2019t join Boeing from GE aerospace. And CMG cfo departure was a planned retirement. So nothing serious to impair the business permanently)\n\nWent to check again what would I be buying with my 7% cash, (it was 10% last month but I bought some stuff during the volatile market. ): \n\nI would not buy anymore Amazon, (or msft or meta), I bought these during 2017 so my costs are low and i intend to hold for a long time these wonderful businesses. \n\nI would buy more GE at 150, I put the fair value around 150 to 170. \n\nI would buy more CMG if the price was lower but I had bought some recently.\n\nI then went to bed, (12 hours ahead here in Asia). Woke up a while ago, found out that it was a -3+% day. And I told myself:\n\nI don\u2019t like it but I accept it.\n\nD. Let me quote the late great Charlie Munger, when asked in 2009 how concerned he was that Berkshire Hathaway shares  dropped more than 50% \n\nBegin quote \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nZero. This is the third time that Warren [Buffett] and I have seen our holdings in Berkshire Hathaway go down, top tick to bottom tick, by 50%. I think it's in the nature of long-term shareholding that the normal vicissitudes in markets means that the long-term holder has the quoted value of his stocks go down by, say, 50%.\n\nIn fact, you can argue that if you're not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you're not fit to be a common shareholder, and you deserve the mediocre result you're going to get compared to the people who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations\n\n\u2014- end quote \n\nE. Have you drawn up a list of stocks which you are prepared to buy when the prices are lower? Have you decided how are you going to raise the cash to buy stocks ? Do you know your portfolio stocks well ? \n\nOf all the questions, the last is the most important. When there is a general shake up, or even a recession, strong companies will recover faster than weaker companies. \n\n\n\n(Btw: yes, my portfolio turnover is <25%, and yes I am still beating the index even after today and despite the low turnover )\n\nMy Previous post on volatility: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/xm9U4eWO0j\n\n\nMy portfolio, one month ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/WIVkHvGzWb\n\n\nMy investing style: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/OeudjgXpf3\n\n\n\n",

He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.\n\n\nEven though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market's quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.\n\nMr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn't\nmind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today,\nhe will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly\nat your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive\nhis behavior, the better for you.\n\n\nBut, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning\nor everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there\nto serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom,\nthat you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly\nfoolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of\nhim, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed,\nif you aren't certain that you understand and can value your business\nfar better than Mr. Market, you don't belong in the game. As they\nsay in poker, \"If you've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't\nknow who the patsy is, you're the patsy.\n\n\n...[A]n investor will succeed by coupling good business\njudgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from\nthe super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace. In\nmy own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to\nkeep Ben's Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.\n\n\nLetter to Shareholders, 1987 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report",

        "post_date": "2024-08-02T12:25:01",
        "post_body": "I'm extremely conflicted on whether or not CROX deserves my investment. 80% of it is a cash cow: extremely profitable, robust growth, and just beautifully run.\n\nThe glaring, ugly, rotting corpse that is the other 20% is weighing the rest of the 80% down is HEYDUDE. Looking at the last q as an example, CROX reported $1,112M in revenue and $326 in operating income. They have decided to stop reporting operating margin by segment because they don't want to make HD look even worse than it obviously is.\n\nOn a segment basis: Crocs contributed $914M. While we don't know for sure, based on previous earnings report, we can assume a 35-37% EBIT margin, so let's call it 35% on the low end which means it contributed $319M to EBIT.\n\nHD contributed $198M in revenue, and if we're lucky, contributed $7M to EBIT (3% margin). If we're unlucky an Crocs had a 37% EBIT, it contributed -12M to EBIT (-6% margin).\n\nLet's break it down by segments and use a sum of parts analysis. Crocs is expected to grow 7-9% on the top line, and we will assume they maintain a 35% EBIT margin (which is bonkers btw). That brings the FY24 revenue to be around $3.27B and $1.14B in EBIT. This is quite frankly conservative as their most recent Q has shown Crocs is killing it internationally.\n\nHD on the other hand is expected to contract -10% - 8% for the FY24 giving us revenue of $850M. Given that we already calculated an EBIT margin of 3%, this gives us an EBIT of $25M. I'm going to be pessimistic and say this is 0 as I hate this segment.\n\nUsing a very conservative 10x PE multiple, less the 1.7B debt CROX acquired from purchasing HD, that would give us an EV of 9.7B, or $153/share, representing 25% upside. Again, this is for a business that has consistent single digit growth with unbelievable margins, rivaling software companies. \n\nThe CEO is refusing to give up on HD, and pouring money to attempt to build it up but the results are just not showing. The market is clearly telling CROX they don't want HeyDude and Andrew Rees, the CEO who I very much respect but am very frustrated with, gave a bullshit answer in response to why they were showing no growth despite the increase in SG&A\n\n>Jonathan Komp\n\n\n>Hi, thank you. Just one more follow-up, but I wanted to ask a bigger picture question around the philosophy for the SG&A investments. And, obviously, this year is a year in which you are planning to grow revenue 3% to 5%. And yet, you are spending almost 20% higher SG&A for the year. So, could you just maybe remind us your overall philosophy? And as we lookout, is there hope that these investments drive faster revenue growth, and any color there in terms of the overall strategy? Thanks.\n\n\n>Andrew Rees\n\n\n>Great question, Jon. So, obviously, we are starting off -- I would say we are starting off from a base of extremely high profitability, right? So, even this year with that distorted investment profile that you just highlighted in your question, we'll achieve kind of 25.5% in terms of EBITD margin, extraordinary level relative to our peers in the industry which we are in, and obviously, that's due to the very high gross margins we experienced on our Crocs brand and also the efficiency of our business model. In terms of philosophy going forward, I think there will be periods of time when we choose to invest in SG&A. Both variable and SG&A because of our marketing is variable and can be turned on and off at any point in time.\nAnd where we will make investments in talent and people and infrastructure and capabilities that we think would be important for the future. The intent of those investments is to support and -- sorry, support and guarantee -- you know guarantees don't work. But, assure long-term growth. So, we are trying to build in a company and a brand that has long-term growth potential and can continue to grow for many years to come. So, I would say there will be periods of time when we distort an SG&A. There were periods of time when we leverage SG&A. And, that's kind of how we think about it from a long-term philosophy perspective.\n\n\nThe market is clearly placing a negative premium on HD, to the tune of -2B. Does it make sense to invest in a company like this, where the CEO is stubborn and refusing to cut off a rotting limb?",

I don\u2019t see it broken out but I assume operating margin is low/negative bc of advertising and trying to grow the brand. I don\u2019t particularly have high hopes for HD, but I do think management is good and has proven they can grow a brand and expand margins.

As a largest manufacturer and retailer of jewelry with a dominant presence in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and other markets, the company boasts a strong financial position and profitability.  Gold jewelry is an important part of Chinese culture, gift giving and store of family wealth.\n\nIts diversified portfolio, spanning gem-set, gold, and platinum jewelry, as well as watch distribution, helps mitigate risks associated with specific product segments. With a substantial market capitalization of HK$ 66.92B (US$ 8.57B), Chow Tai Fook offers investors liquidity and stability. The company's valuation metrics, including a moderate P/E ratio of 10.3 suggest potential undervaluation relative to its earnings and sales. Chow Tai Fook's profitability is evident in its 5.98% profit margin and 21.99% return on equity, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity. The company's strong presence in the growing Chinese luxury market and expansion into other regions present significant growth potential. However, investors should be mindful of the company's debt levels and its sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending trends. Overall, Chow Tai Fook appears to be a well-established player in the jewelry industry, offering exposure to the broader Asian luxury goods market.\u00a0 \n\nThe company appears to be undervalued historically compared to its price ratio's over the last decade.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0[https://userupload.gurufocus.com/1819482299427876864.png](https://userupload.gurufocus.com/1819482299427876864.png)\n\n\u00a0Revenue has increased at the rate of 7% CAGR and operating income at the rate of 6.7% CAGR over the last 10 years, yet the stock price is below the IPO price of HK$15 from 2011.\u00a0 **The company pays a generous dividend of 8.03%.**",

        "post_body": "I have leaps expiring June 2025 for 19$ I was up a lot and recently went down. My argument for why this company could see a revival in the stock price is as follows. Pre-pandemic stock price of 48$-52$ plus dividends. The stock was hit hard by the Covid lockdown and required a high level of debt to keep the company afloat. As the lockdown has ended and travel has came back, they\u2019ve been able to beat expectations and are making a profit before debt. They\u2019ve been working on paying down debt  and turning their debt to asset ratio around. Also with interest rates almost guaranteed to start coming down, they would be able to refinance some of the debt at more favorable rates which could help accelerate the the debt repayment and path to being cash flow positive. \nPossible negative scenarios which could affect a rebound are 1.) Possible recession and general stock market downturn. 2) Deeper recession that will slow vacation spending and affect growth/profitability. 3.) The high debt level which even a smaller decrease in revenue could affect its debt repayment progress and leave the company overwhelmed.\nThat\u2019s my analysis and I\u2019m looking for discussion/criticism of my thesis. I only bought a couple of calls so far and am trying to decide if I should add more at this more favorable price or it would be catching a falling knife? ",

If they can manage the debt and bring capex down to pre 2019 levels this may look like a good debt.\n\n\n19B market cap, around 29B net debt, free cash flow ttm around 1.6B, if they can reduce the capex to 3B we would potentially look at 4.5B maybe even 5B free cash flow, most which will go to debt payments most likely but we are still looking at a potentially 25%+ free cash flow yield.\n\n\nSo it doesn't look bad if things go according to the plan. The only problem is that we may enter a small recession and consumers are already consuming less discretionary goods (clothes, eating out, theme parks (see comcast & disney)). A lot of these risks are probably baked in at current price level but i wouldn't say the margin of safety is as big as you may think, maybe a fair value around 20-25 but if things work out this could definitely explode to 35-45 levels. Still, the management has a lot of work to bring it to prepandemic levels.\n\n\u00a0",

But after the shutdown of COVID-19, the Board decided to sell the company to Bowlero, at a lower price (smth around $44M) than it should have to hurry the process.\u00a0\n\nThe investors sued them for it back then. But, the good news is that they now agreed to pay shareholders to solve this scandal. So, if you bought it back then, you can check the details and [file for the payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/bowlamerica-investor-settlement).\n\nAnyways, do you think the merger was a good idea or could Bowl America recover after COVID-19 on its own?

Although certs don\u2019t hold much weight, Courseras certification are sponsored by some meaningful institutions. I also really like Courseras government program. I find it to be a hedge for unemployment where governments would be paying for reskilling of employees. I also like their online degree program, albeit it\u2019s a small revenue source. At the time I was buying, coursera was trading at 0.6x revenue while udemy was 1.0+. That may have switched now.\n\nOne thing you can do is, if you believe in the tailwinds of the industry (e.g, global reskilling), you can split your holdings between udemy and coursera. However, I do believe coursera is the better company out of the two.\n\nMy PT for coursera is $16 based on a weighted approach between implied multiples and growth forecasts.",

I am trying to get the financial information of apple : from the income statement, balance sheet, stockholders equity and cash flow.\n I am running into a problem tho : \nIn the apple published 2019 annual report (10-k) the basic EPS is 11.97, and the diluted one id 11.89.\n Same goes for 2018 where it\u2019s 12.01 and 11.91 respectively. \nAnd also for 2017 where it\u2019s 9.27 and 9.21 respectively.\nWhen i search on macro-trend and yahoo finance for the eps basic and diluted, and they gave me very different results: no more than $3.00 eps basic or diluted. \nI don\u2019t know if I should stick with the apple reports or i should go for the yahoo and macro trend results. \nEssentially I got suspicious because of the huge decline from $11 to $12 eps in 2018-2019 to $2.32 and $3.00 in 2020-2021. Now i know corona virus was devastating but this much?\n\nI am using these information to find key metric and ratios that make great companies great. It\u2019s a big basic eps jump from $12 to 3$ according to the apple annual report, and a small jump from $3 to $2.32 eps basic according to macro trend and yahoo finance.This will alter everything in term of the key metric and ratio change that i will be taking as a great indication for a good company.\n\nMy question is should i trust the apple annual reports or the yahoo finance one?

        "post_date": "2024-08-02T02:17:13",
        "post_body": "**Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW)**\n\n**Investment Report**\n\n**NYSE: BBW**\n\n**Market capitalization:** 356 million dollars\n\n**P/E ratio:** 7.25\n\n**Div yield:** 3.16%\n\n\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **International Expansion:** Plans to open at least 50 new locations in fiscal 2024, focusing on non-traditional and high-traffic areas.\n* **Management Commitment to Shareholder Returns:** Significant capital returns through share repurchases and a new quarterly dividend, in combination more than 30 million over the last 12 months.\n* **Improving Gross Margins:** Achieved record gross margins of 54.2% in Q1, demonstrating effective cost management and pricing strategies.\n\n\n\n**1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction:**\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE: BBW) has had an impressive start to the year, with its stock price surging over 40%. Despite this strong performance, the first quarter results showed a slight decline, with revenues down 4.4% year-over-year and pre-tax income dropping by 22.3%, this numbers were lower than those expected by Wall Street, this caused the stock to plunge over 20%. However, the management remains confident in their full-year outlook, projecting total revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range and pre-tax income growth in the low single digits. This optimism is supported by plans for at least 50 new experience locations.\n\nImportantly, Build-A-Bear is experiencing record gross margins, demonstrating effective cost management, and pricing strategies. The company\u2019s gross margin for Q1 was 54.2%. Management has shown a strong commitment to shareholder returns, with over $30 million returned through share repurchases and a new dividend in the past 12 months. Despite the short-term disappointment, Build-A-Bear remains a compelling investment opportunity with solid growth strategies, robust financial health, and ongoing shareholder rewards. According to my DCF valuation the stock should be worth around 41.65 dollars, representing a 60% upside potential from current prices.\n\n**2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Business model:**\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE: BBW) is a global retail brand that offers a unique, interactive shopping experience focused on the creation of customizable plush toys. Founded in 1997 and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, BBW has evolved into a beloved brand that sells to a diverse customer base, including children, adults, and collectors. The company operates through various retail formats, including corporately managed stores, partner-operated locations, and international franchises.\n\n**2.1 Unique Selling Proposition**\n\nBBW's core business model revolves around providing a highly interactive and personalized experience where customers can create their own plush toys. This involves choosing the toy, stuffing it, adding sounds and scents, dressing it in various outfits, and completing the creation with a personalized birth certificate. This hands-on experience differentiates BBW from other toy retailers.\n\n**2.2 Retail Stores:**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Corporately-Managed Locations: \u00a0These stores are directly operated by BBW and are primarily located in high-traffic shopping malls and tourist destinations. As of May 2024, BBW operates 357 corporately managed stores globally.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Partner-Operated Stores: These stores are operated by third-party partners who bear the cost of setting up and running the stores. BBW supplies the inventory at wholesale prices, receiving revenue without significant capital investment. There are 97 partner-operated stores worldwide.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Franchise Locations: BBW franchises its brand to international partners who operate the stores under the BBW brand, paying royalties based on sales. There are 77 franchise stores in various international markets.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Operating strategies:**\n\nManagement continues to believe in the initiatives that were put in place prior to the pandemic and the intend to continue pursuing them. There are three main operating strategies:\n\n**3.1 Global expansion:**\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop is expanding its unique experience locations globally. In fiscal 2023, the company opened a net 37 new locations, including corporately managed, third-party operated, and franchise models. For fiscal 2024, Build-A-Bear plans at least 50 new units in North America and internationally. The company is focusing on non-traditional locations such as family-centric tourist sites and partner-operated venues, with over 35% of its stores now in these settings. Additionally, Build-A-Bear is innovating with vending machines, known as automatic teddy machines, to further extend its brand reach.\n\n\n\n**3.2 E-Commerce and Digital Channels:**\n\nBBW has a robust e-commerce platform that complements its physical store presence. The website allows customers to design and purchase customized plush toys online. This channel has grown significantly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has been investing in their digital presence and it starts paying off, online sales have tripled since 2018.\n\n**3.3 Driving growth while returning capital to shareholders:**\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop is driving profitable growth through new shop openings while maintaining a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Despite inflationary pressures, wage increases, and supply chain challenges, the company's disciplined expense management and higher revenue levels have kept corporate store operating margins robust. Improved cash flows have supported key growth initiatives and enabled capital returns to shareholders. This includes two special dividends totaling $42 million, share repurchases from a $25 million program initiated in November 2021, a $50 million program announced in August 2022, and a new quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share announced in March 2024.\n\n\n\n**4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sharon Price John CEO**\n\nSharon Price John has been the CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop since June 2013. She has a background in leadership roles in places such as Stride Rite Children's Group, Hasbro. Under her guidance, Build-A-Bear has expanded globally and enhanced its digital presence.\n\nImportantly, Sharon Price John holds approximately 4% of Build-A-Bear's shares, valued at around $15 million. This significant ownership aligns her interests with those of the shareholders, ensuring a strong commitment to driving long-term value and maintaining robust financial performance.\n\n\n\n**5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financials**:\n\n**5.1 Revenue and gross margin:**\n\nAs we can see earnings have been growing at a rapid pace during the last year, % of COGS as revenue is the lowest it has ever been, representing that the company is able to charge a premium for their products even during an inflationary environment, cost cutting and an increase in online sales has also helped.\n\n**5.2 Profitability:**\n\nThe company has been able to turnaround their business model after the pandemic, increasing net margins drastically and bringing EBITDA from 4.49 million dollars in 2018 to 79.18 million dollars in 2023. Net margin is around 10% and I expect it to remain there for my forecast.\n\n\n\n**6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thesis:**\n\nMy thesis is based on three main assumptions:\n\n**Low Capex requirements:**\n\nIn projecting the company's financials, I anticipate depreciation and amortization to represent approximately 3.5% of revenues, aligning with historical trends. I expect capital expenditures to represent about 3.3% of the company's revenue, supporting its expansion and modernization initiatives while leaving a good amount of cash to give back to shareholders.\n\n**Slight margin contraction:**\n\nTo remain conservative, I foresee a slight contraction in margins over the next decade. This expectation accounts for potential challenges such as inflationary pressures, increased wages, and supply chain disruptions. Despite these headwinds, Build-A-Bear's robust operational efficiency and cost management strategies should help mitigate significant margin erosion.\n\n**Management\u2019s focus on producing shareholder value:**\n\nA key aspect of Build-A-Bear's investment appeal is its management's focus on returning capital to shareholders. The company is starting to build a track record of doing so through dividends and share buybacks. As Build-A-Bear continues to demonstrate its ability to sustain and grow its dividend while effectively executing share repurchase programs, I believe the market will recognize this stability and commitment, resulting in a higher valuation multiple for the stock.\n\n\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nI expect the company\u2019s revenue to grow 3% this following year and continue growing at a conservative 4%. I expect that gross margins will fall by 2% over the following 10 years and the same will happen to net margins.\n\nOn a P/E basis I think the company will be worth 54.67 dollars in 2023 not considering any possible buybacks.\n\nFor a more accurate valuation I will make a DCF model following my D&A and Capex expectations. I expect the exit FCF yield to be 7.5%.\n\nAccording to my DCF model and using a discount rate of 12% this stock is worth 41,65, Thanks to the recent decline, we are able to buy the stock with a big margin of safety.\n\n**7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Risks:**\n\n**Smaller competitors wining over market share**: even though it is highly unlikely that other competitors will be able to take market share from them because they offer a unique experience, and they have a strong brand image.\n\n**Hyper-inflation**: if inflation comes back to high levels, it is possible that we see an increase in costs and lower demand on the consumer side.\n\n**8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion:**\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE: BBW) is a compelling investment opportunity despite recent short-term setbacks. The company's strategic international expansion, robust e-commerce growth, and strong focus on returning capital to shareholders position it well for sustained growth.\n\nWith conservative financial projections indicating a 4% CAGR in revenue and prudent margin management, Build-A-Bear remains resilient against economic challenges. Current valuations suggest the stock is undervalued, providing a significant margin of safety.\n\nInvesting in Build-A-Bear Workshop is recommended to diversify your portfolio beyond tech, offering stability and growth potential backed by solid fundamentals and shareholder-friendly policies.\n\nIf you want to see the graphs and valuation images go to my substack:  \n[https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/build-a-bear-workshop-bbw-small-cap?r=1od1d5](https://smallcaptreasures.substack.com/p/build-a-bear-workshop-bbw-small-cap?r=1od1d5)",

The switch up to a more omnidirectional approach and the shift in numbers that it has garnered is encouraging to me.  \n  \nI view this as a riskier invest due to their size and niche.

I won\u2019t get into them too much, there has already been a post on COUR here by u/cagr_capital that I think is a great read, and the thesis has proven true so far with what was a great earnings report by COUR last week.

        "post_date": "2024-08-02T06:06:35",
        "post_body": "Seven West Media Limited (\u2018**SWM**\u2019) \n\nMarket: ASX\n\nCurrent share price: AUD$0.18\n\nMarket Cap: 277,050,000\n\n\nI do not own any shares in SWM. \nThis is an opportunity I have identified using my own metrics and risk appetite. SWM may not rise in value or even hold its value. All opinions are my own, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Do your own research.\n\n\n**Description:**\n\nSWM operates as an integrated media company, engaging in the free to air television broadcasting and digital streaming in Australia and internationally. SWM owns channel 7 and its associated channels on free to air TV as well on digital platforms. SWM also owns a number of newspapers and magazines. \n\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nSWM traded at a peak of ~$15 in 2007, and has since been in a steady decline to its current trading price. \n\n\nSWM operates in an industry with high competition, and has little to no growth prospects as it competes with the likes of Netflix and other digital platforms who are taking market share from free-to-air TV consumers, as well as Kayo (Australian digital sport subscription service) who covers the same sports and more. \n\n\n**My Hypothesis:**\n\nIn this instance, I do not see value in the vision of the future of this business, but I do see value in what the business is right now. The stock price is far too low for what this company offers right now, and the market has overreacted to the downturn of the industry in my opinion. SWM has had an average revenue of ~AUD$1.5 billion for the last 10 years. Given, over that time it has suffered a major decline, and it is anticipated to continue falling. SWM continues to have a strong Free Cash flow of ~$100 million over the past 10 years. I do not see any significant issues with the financial statements, and 49% of the groups EBITDA is generated by digital platforms - showing a strong business transformation. SWM has a spine of about 5 legacy Australia TV shows (Sunrise, the morning show, the chase, the news and Home & away) and SWM has extended the broadcasting rights for the AFL (Australia\u2019s biggest sport) and the Cricket (I believe this is just the BBL, 20 over national league - the 4th most watched league in Australia) until 2031. Starting in September 2024, these agreements include digital rights for the first time which will be interesting to see how this is implemented and how it competes with Kayo. September 2024 is the AFL finals, which should increase viewership and facilitate some digital transition. \n\n\nSWM is one of the most undervalued stocks on the Australian market:\nPE Ratio - 3.33 (Peer average ~19)\nP/S - 0.2\nP/CF - 5.44\nP/B 0.64\nWhat sticks out to me is that the book value per SWM share is actually higher than its current share price (~0.24 vs 0.18). This of course reflects the poor future outlook, however we are still anticipating decent revenues, profits and FCF\u2019s a few years to come. The future cash flows (with very humble assumptions) implies a target price of ~0.6. While I do not condone ever relying on a DCF, this is just something that shows what the price is capable of if investor sentiment changes. The current share price reflects a company that is anticipated to bleed out and collapse in the near future - however I don\u2019t believe this is the case and if the stock price reflects this then it will experience a significant increase. \n\n\nThis is a very risky venture. This stock is highly volatile, boasting a 52 week range of 0.165 - 0.41. Over the past 5 years it has experienced a low of 0.08 and a high of 0.70. Over the long term, this stock has proven to be a poor investment, however in the shorter term it can be a profitable venture. SWM is 0.85% shorted.\n\n\nIn summary, it is too early to close the doors on SWM. This is still a company with significant turnover that has become far more profitable over the last few years. They possess 5 legacy TV shows, the rights to 2 of Australia\u2019s top 5 sports leagues and much more. They have a plan for the future, digitalising its platform that will make it somewhat competitive moving forward. I believe the market has overreacted, SWM is here to stay (and be profitable) for at least the foreseeable future and  the current share price does not reflect this outcome.\n\n\n\n\n**Debt:**\n\nSWM is not in significant debt, with total debt in the high AUD$400m and net debt at around AUD$250m. SWM has decreased its total debt for the last 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n**Insider Buying**:\n\nI would much prefer this stock if it had insider buying, however, the last significant insider buy was in 2021.\n\n\nSWM is ~51% owned by insiders.\n\n\nPlease share any views you might have. This is something I am strongly considering - and there isn't as much conversation or information on Australia stocks as there is on American stocks (seeking alpha, etc.) Cheers!",

It took many years to get to a place where they needed to cut the dividend, and the problem won't be fixed quickly.\n\nThrough 2013, Intel was gifted at bringing up a very good design and a very good fab process at the exact same time.  Their ability to partner design with operations was amazingly strong, and led to a monopoly type position.\n\nIn 2013, Brian Krzanich was put in charge, and he decided to starve technology into the fabs so Intel could expand into new areas.  He had a monopoly, and he figure he could coast in CPUs and finance new areas.  I'm not even convinced this was a bad idea.  The problem is Brian slept with a subordinate, so they exited him.  Brian was bright and technical.  \n\nThe board decided that Intel had grown beyond needing an engineer at the top of the company, so they put Bob Swan, the CFO in charge.  Brian had just made a decision to starve 10nm, and Bob continued with Brian's template.  As a CFO, he didn't understand technology, and didn't realize that Bob had made a bad decision to starve the fabs.\n\nBecause of Intel's almost monopoly, they used their muscle power to keep share.  The problem is that 99% of finance people aren't passionate about driving the absolute best technical decision to create the world's best product.  The always say, \"why can't you just live with last year's equipment.\"\n\nThe heart of any fab is the lithography equipment.  ASML was the only provider of EUV equipment in the world, which allowed you to get to 10nm (and beyond) comfortably. Because of the path established by Brian, and then Bob's continuation,  Intel decided to push their old equipment to 10nm.  TSMC went all in on ASML.\n\nIt turns out that Intel made a really bad decision and TSMC made a really good decision.  TSMC running ASML did much better at 10, and allowed TSMC to then move their customers to 7nm.  AMD, who had a good design and used TSMC as their fab, out performed Intel nicely because they ramped 10nm and 7nm way ahead of Intel due to TSMC.  Cloud companies that only considered Intel suddenly were engaging AMD.\n\nThis was just a massive screw-up, and the Intel board knew it after the fact and decided to get ride of Bob Swan.  In contrast, AMD was turning around and being run by Lisa Su, a PhD in material science from MIT.  There are very few high tech companies with vigorous competition that can be run by finance guys or marketing guys.  (Intel in there hay-day was lead by Dr. Andy Grove, who wrote the college text book \"Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices (1967)\")\n\nThe Board turned to Pat Gelsinger in 2021.  While Pat is very good and has his degree in electrical engineering, he had been away from Intel for many years and running a software company.  Hardware and software are very different mindsets.  \n\nUnfortunately, fabs are really, really hard to turn around.  From the moment that Intel order a piece of ASML equipment to having it up and running will be around 2 years.  In other words, Pat has a two year lead time (or more) from the very time he says \"here is the strategy.\"\n\nPat was banking on a strong economy, being able to turn around the fabs, and the chip act to help prop up Intel.  He thought that he could squeeze out enough cash flow to keep the dividend, while fixing the fab and design teams.\n\nHowever, the cloud makers, who have become a significant share of Intel's TAM, really embraced AMD.  This isn't the biggest issue, the bigger issue is that the Cloud guys have a limited budget, and they said, \"We need to buy AI chips like nVidia, and all our customers are shifting our focus to them.\"  Intel compute revenue is under attack from AMD and nVidia.  \n\nSo, while Pat should have immediately cut the dividend and redeployed opex sooner, he is trying to do it now.  Fixing the problem is going to be expensive when your TAM is under attack from AMD and nVidia.  I have no idea of what he has in the pipeline, but with the lead times, he may need two years to get new equipment in the door and just starting a new ramp.\n\nStrategically, the chips are stacked against Intel being able to pivot quickly.\n\nOn top of that, two things will happen:\n\n1. When you cut your dividend, your investor base rotates out from underneath you.  There are a lot of investors that bought Intel thinking they would get a predictable dividend while the company recovered.  All of these investor will rotate out of the stock, and this will drag on the stock for many months if not years.\n\n2.  A heavy headcount cut like this is a shock to the system.  Generally, high tech companies does very well with a headcount cut because they are innovative.  Generally, a headcount cut forces the team to create tools to replace people.  However, there is always a drop in production as the shock of the people being cut is emotionally really hard.\n\nI wouldn't count out Intel.  Intel spent years collecting the best and brightest and has an incredible IP portfolio.  If the strategy is fixed, then the core of the company can see a great turn around.  It just will take time.",

AMD has a superior product, and Intel is severely lagging in the AI space. I don\u2019t see any kind of moat for them.  The only scenario where I might consider Intel is if it drops below the $6 mark for its liquidation value, and even then, it would likely take a long time to rebound. A crucial point is that all major AI investments are happening now, and Intel has missed this golden opportunity. Big tech companies are investing billions in their AI infrastructure, and Intel is capturing very little of this delicious pie, which is extremely frustrating and this something i don\u2019t give companies much slack on those one in kind opportunities should never be missed missing them can literally end you (think of nokia Kodak etc).  You should also consider the opportunity cost of investing in Intel right now. What returns are you expecting from Intel, and when do you realistically think you\u2019ll recoup your investment?

And we're supposed to believe that they can catch up with TSMC by 2026? It's basically magical thinking.\n\nAnd yes, they will receive a lot of support from the US government, now that industrial policy is back in vogue. But one of the learnings from Chinese investors (who have a lot more experience dealing with industrial policy than anyone in the west) is that investing in national champions is actually often a pretty painful experience. \n\nUS equity investors are used to investing in companies that are trying to create value for equity holders. But national champions are usually more focused on their \"national service\".

Now that hasn't been proven or even speculated but it's being thought about. Hopefully the fix will prevent premature death of those long enough for server refreshes which usually occur every 5, 7, 10, or more years. \n\nIt's a pretty large reputational hit which might take a long time to heal. \n\nMy 2 cents! Have a great rest of your day.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that it not only a voltage problem, but an oxidation problem as well. That is something wrong with the manufacturing itself....

And we're supposed to believe that they can catch up with TSMC by 2026? It's basically magical thinking.\n\nAnd yes, they will receive a lot of support from the US government, now that industrial policy is back in vogue. But one of the learnings from Chinese investors (who have a lot more experience dealing with industrial policy than anyone in the west) is that investing in national champions is actually often a pretty painful experience. \n\nUS equity investors are used to investing in companies that are trying to create value for equity holders. But national champions are usually more focused on their \"national service\". Even if Intel's process roadmap somehow works, it's not clear that shareholders will ever see the money, as opposed to Intel reinvesting it into building chip capacity for the military, or whatever the White House's latest policy goal might be.",

Upper management and executives will ask the middle managers for lists of projects their direct reports are working on, and look at performance reviews, but then hand down the list of layoffs from the top. Middle managers never get to make these decisions, and are usually completely blindsided by them.

There is a sort of wall street legend (I've never seen publication of the actual original study, but TONS of reputable people talk about it) that a Fidelity study of their top 200 returning retail accounts (in an effort to find unknown wiz-kids) found that the majority of out performing account holders were people who had lost their passwords and ultimately forgot about the account, or were dead and the next of kin didn't know about the account. \n\n2. Everybody RADICALLY over estimates their ability to hold through draw downs. Warren and Charlie saw Berkshire Hathaway draw down 50% \\*twice\\*. The fact that we've been on a downward trajectory in the market since July 16th isn't any big deal. \n\n3. To attempt to quote Howard Marks \"There are two types of investors, those who think they predict the future, and those who know they can't.\" My take is not to worry. I have extremely high confidence in the stocks I've bought, if they get hammered 20%+ more in some wild draw down we have or are having, so much the better, I'll buy more. The only rebalancing I'm thinking about doing is if one of my highest conviction picks gets destroyed I would gladly sell some other picks to concentrate more.",

                "comment_body": "Okay, the headline might be a bit of click bait as in reality, insight is one of the main reasons that Berkshire INCREASED their share of Apple.  Buffet had allowed Weschler to buy Apple in 2016, but there is still a good message here.\n\nWhile Berkshire is remarkably transparent about many things, Buffet has never spent a bunch of time describing how exactly he gets to some of his buys.  Although the link above is a bit older, I think it delivers a good message about the role of insight leading analysis.\n\nWhile Buffet calls Apple his single best investment, Buffet did not own an Apple phone until 2020 because he liked a simple flip phone.  So, Buffet did not buy Apple because of tech.\n\nTed Weschler is one of Berkshire's stock pickers and a brilliant mind.  Weschler was extremely successful before ever joining Buffet, but does not look like he wants the limelight, so he is not going to be Buffet's successor, although I think he could be.\n\nIt is my speculation that Weschler knew and understood the brand loyalty of Apple buyers, and when a Board Member lost his iPhone, it allowed Weschler to go into Warren and say, \"Look Warren, we need to trade off of not only the numbers but the brand loyality.\"\n\nWarren loves good brand loyalty, and this is why he always brings up See's Candies, although it is some 1/10 of one percent of his holdings.  He is very willing to bring brand into his moat.\n\nNow Apple in 2016 did have a good capital structure and good cash flow, but it was not compelling.  Carl Icahn at the time was getting out of the stock because he said, \"Their best days are done.\"  Apple had a PE of 10 at the time, which sounds mindblowing good, until you realize that Intel and Microsoft were roughly in the same range.  The general market was a buying opp.\n\nThe bulk of Apple was actually bought in 2017 and 2018.  While 2016 got Berkshire engaged, it was the next couple of years that proved it out.  I think this is another lesson, get something into your portfolio early, then watch it.",

Sure there was \"goodwill,\" but this was the exception rather than the rule.  You put in goodwill because the numbers didn't add up, and you needed a gap filler.   But as business developed and IP became more important, we saw this change.  For me, FASB publishing 86 in the '80s was a real change.  Suddenly, business needed to capitalize software.  \n\nIn tangible assets such as investment for companies, FASB forces a company to readjust an investment asset to a market price yearly.  But because IP or IP assets are so hard to value, the best they do is force companies to record the cost of asset creation, like software R&D.  Maybe it is a bit better than goodwill, but not much.  \n\nNow I am not suggesting FASB require IP or intangible assets to be clearly valued because we have no good tools to do this.  But just because valuation is difficult, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and shouldn't fit into your value equation at some strategic level.\n\nSo if you took a classic Graham model of \"only invest in companies where your total assets are more than your capitalization,\" Apple would have not been a great buy.  Maybe okay, but not great.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to say, \"I can't perfectly value the IP that this company has with it's user base, but it appears to me that it is massive and adds to the capitalization of the company,\" I'll argue that this is an important recasting of why considering IP / Intangible Assets are so important.\n\nI'll also mention that some companies have negative IP on their books, and we should also try to think this through on a strategic level.",

No, it just means that the numbers went up at the right time and Elon is one of the richest people as a result, richer than Buffett in fact. \n\nSo is Elon smarter than Buffett because he has more money and has won at a higher rate? \n\nI certainly don't think so.

You get that by dividing Berkshire\u2019s 3,787,464% return by the S&P\u2019s 24,708% return. Which shows that Berkshire\u2019s return was a tad more than 153 times the S&P\u2019s return.\n\nBuffet and Munger were a team, I think I even like Munger more than Buffet, but if you dont have the upmost respect for Buffet, you are a fucking idiot. His annual shareholder letters, which you clearly haven\u2019t read, show his intellect and investment wisdom.\n\nMaybe you ought to read more about Munger and Buffet. They are/were humble educators that acted with integrity in business. Do you ever ask why they became so famous in the first place? They did things differently than everyone else and were more transparent with shareholders with their annual shareholders letter than any other company has been, and they used that medium to teach. Their \u201cstudents\u201d that listened and owned Berkshire Hathaway stock became very wealthy. Berkshire Hathaway is structured differently than any other conglomerate and the reasoning for it is laid out in the letters.\n\nAlso, my guy, read your comment I am replying to.

Should new individuals lean on index funds and ETFs as they learn more? Yes. Should they just not even bother to learn more as 99% of these comments suggest and just give up on value investing with ETFs and index funds as an alternative? No. Proper value investing provides you with the opportunity to outperform leading ETFs, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. So please, stop quickly dismissing newcomers as if you've somehow obtained a body of knowledge they could never learn themselves. We were all new to this at some point and we all started in a similar place. You should be willing to give real advice on value investing, if you can't do that then head over to r/ETFs where you can recommend ETFs to people all day and you'd actually be doing it in a sub that is meant for that.

The company reported a decline in average daily volume and a substantial drop in operating profit for its U.S. Domestic Package division.  UPS warned that the current quarter would be particularly challenging, projecting a 40% year-over-year profit decline. These challenges, along with aggressive cost-cutting measures and underperformance compared to competitors, contributed to negative investor sentiment and a significant decrease in share price.\n\nHowever from a value perspective UPS stock is currently at deep discount to its 10 year median price metrics.  \n\n[https://userupload.gurufocus.com/1819169168474402816.png](https://userupload.gurufocus.com/1819169168474402816.png)\n\nWhile the stock may take time to revive, value investors may want to buy when things look hairy for the eventual rebound.

If you read through the 10-K and other documents, you will see he owns almost no stake in the company, less than .01%, but holds total voting control. As you read further, you will find that the company engages another private company, \u201cCastor Ships\u201d,  to \u201cmanage\u201d the business (think every business function from marketing to bookkeeping), for which CTRM pays a handsome management fee. Coincidentally, the CEO owns \u201cCastor Ships\u201d. In 2022, this was what Castor Ships received for the management services:\n\n1) $3,000,000 (annually)\n2) A daily fee of $925 per container ship and bulk vessel \n3) A commission of 1.25% of gross income from vessel operations \n4) A commission of 1% on the sale of ships purchased and sold \n\nIn 2022, management fees to CEO affiliates companies was ~$15M.\n\nFurthermore, ships routinely get sold to affiliated companies. So not only we don\u2019t know how fair these prices are but the affiliated company picks up a commission on a related party transaction. \n\nCTRM is the perfect example of a value trap. There are clearly valuable assets but they won\u2019t get unlocked because it\u2019s not in management\u2019s interest when they can simply siphon money through management deals and not include the common shareholders who financed the operation.",

There are many specifics involved in this, such as the technical details of shale oil development and China's massive oil reserves, but the bottom line is that the impact would not be as devastating today. \n\n2) Now that shale oil and electric vehicles exist, any increase in oil prices accelerates OPEC's loss of market share. The critical historical moment that broke OPEC's back was the 2014-2016 oil price war when OPEC tried - and failed - to bankrupt the shale industry. From that moment forward, OPEC has been careful not to raise oil prices too much lest they lower their long-term profits. I.e. OPEC lost its monopoly status and now must play by market rules. They do not want a disruption of oil markets. \n\n3) Disrupting enough oil production/transport to spike global oil prices would immediately piss off 80% of the world. The US alone has enough strategic bombers to bomb the entire Middle East back into the stone age. That does not include our tactical aircraft, carrier groups, cruise missiles, or ground assets in the area. Now imagine every oil-importing nation in the world angry enough to curb-stomp whichever impudent little sh\\*t disrupted the global economy. Normally, politicians must be careful lest they anger their voters... but if everyone on earth was feeling it in their wallets, politicians would have a hall pass for whatever heinous acts may be required. It would be the end of whoever dared disrupt oil - and they know it. Any local warmongers will carefully avoid pissing off the rest of the world. \n\ntl;dr Israel may go to war with the entire Middle East, but the spice will flow regardless.",

Sitting in third party countries while sending young people off to die for the cause you indoctrinated them into is bad for all sides. \n\nMaybe the next crop of dudes at the top will think maybe we should saber rattle and chill. Maybe the when this round of nuttiness is over the powers that be will sit down and quietly have a chat about what is and is not reasonable, They might disagree about reasonable, but if you know that the other side has red lines that will result in you personally being targeted perhaps you might consider a bit more carefully your actions. \n\n  \nOil went up today. I suspect it will go up more each and every day until this drama plays out a bit. If Iran starts shooting at Saudi Arabia directly thats when things will hit the fan. Until then its all just louder versions of the usual noise. \n\nIsrael however needs new political leadership. The dude hasn't got the job done and wont quit when its clear people want him gone. I know it might not be popular with some folks but I think the response to October was screwed up. They should have gone in, created a massive camp, let the civilians enter it, fed and housed those civilians (expensive yes, but worth it) and then went about the business of dealing with Hamas. Like it or not the bulk of the people in Gaza are either militants, civilians who dont want to be militants but cant leave, or they are children who will eventually fall into one of those two camps. killing a bunch of people and leveling their homes is a recipe for making more people dislike you even more. When people dislike you the odds they become a militant or support a militant goes up. Im not saying Gazans alive today will ever be friends with Israel, but until you solve problems better its hard to expect things to improve. Showing you care more about Gazans than the militants do would bear fruit given enough time, but it will take a lot of time.... like decades.",

Other oil projects typically take years, which is why supply was so much more brittle before shale oil. \n\n2) Unlike the US, China does not disclose their strategic reserves or total consumption. We only know that when oil prices are below average, China buys a lot more oil and stores it in massive underground caverns. We also know that China has a track record of stockpiling critical resources (E.g. pork) and using those reserves to temper market extremes. China is most certainly prepared for oil supply disruptions, and that will temper world markets. \n\n3) The US has developed a habit of curbing oil supply. E.g. funding a civil war in Libya, sanctioning Venezuela, shutting down American pipelines, banning production in Alaska, banning production on federal land, etc. There are also countries that under-produce because corruption discourages private investment. In an emergency, the US could certainly lift sanctions, shift political priorities, open the already-built pipelines, and strong-arm corrupt nations into being less corrupt. The oil supply is remarkably flexible when the Powers That Be want it to be flexible. \n\n4) 20 years ago, we were worried about finding enough oil. Today, we have a surplus at <$80/barrel. Shale oil sets the price ceiling. Because the price of oil is set by the most expensive barrel, losing Saudi Arabia's $20/bbl oil production will not drive up long-term prices; it will create a temporary price spike that permanently decreases OPEC's market share. OPEC no longer has the financial reserves to fight price wars or to lose market share, and they no longer have pricing power. They *really* don't want supply disruption because it will decrease their cumulative revenues. In some cases, a disruption would bankrupt entire nations. \n\n5) In the 1980's, Iran disrupted oil flows by attacking Iraqi oil tankers and mining the Persian Gulf. The US planned a \"proportional\" response that resulted in half of Iran's navy sunk in a single afternoon because American pilots/sailors intentionally picked extra fights. No Middle Eastern country can stand against the US military. If we decide they've crossed a line, they're done. The maximum time Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz is the amount of time it would take us to remove the mines, which is <1 month. That's aside from the fact that we now have satellite surveillance, which means we'd likely catch them before the mines were even distributed. The Strait of Hormuz is staying open as long as we want it open. \n\nWill markets panic about oil supplies? Probably. Will it last long? Probably not. It would be like trading GME with the WallStreetBets degenerates.",

During this process, Viatris issued 560M more shares to distribute among Mylan's investors. But then Viatris was accused of \u201cmisleading\u201d their Registration statement, which hid their not-so-good business in China due to their political situation and faced high competition in Japan.\n\n\n\nWhen all this came to light, they lost almost $1B in value from the offering price. But the good news is that they already agreed to pay a $16M settlement to resolve this situation. And, they\u00b4re accepting late claims. So, if someone's late, you can still [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/viatris-investor-settlement).\n\n\n\nAnyway, do you think that this merger was for the better? Did anybody here invest in these companies by any chance?\n\n",

Some ppl. say that the p/e ratio is extremely important. But, by that logic, Alphabet Class C (Google) has a low p/e ratio, 25, & is a large, powerful company.  By that logic, ought I to purchase it?\n\nRolls Royce has a low p/e ratio of 19 , & has experienced collosal growth over the past yr. or so. Ought I to buy that?\n\n**Analysing Companies**\n\nI know that some investors advise you to learn how to read a balance sheet.  I have a book about how to read balance sheets, that I've not yet read. I will do so before I actually invest in anything properly.  Will this actually help? \n\nBut, then, I've heard very good investors talk about \"hollow\" companies. The idea is, as I understand it,  many of a modern corperations assets are intangible (i.e. brand power & customer loyalty , etc. ).  Buffet once said something like: \"If you have to sit down & work it all out, don't bother investing in it\".  But,  presumably, this doesn't mean that investing is an easy / simple process?\n\n  \nSorry for this slightly incoherent, rambling post.  I hope someone can assist me.

It\u2019s actually the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet that you want to worry about, not just the latter.\n\nThe p/e is a hard concept to explain without a lot of detail. But essentially it\u2019s a pricing metric. People will often talk about stocks \u2018trading at X multiple\u2019. The p/e is an example of one multiple. Another is price/free cash flow (which should be in line with p/e over the long term). The lower they are, the cheaper the stock is (I.e if you had two companies with the exact same financials, the one with the lower multiple is cheaper). \n\nStocks get priced at certain multiples for all sorts of reasons. Some are intangible as you said. Normally Google trades at a multiple in the 20\u2019s, so if they were trading at a 14 p/e and the company was just as healthy, then that would likely be undervalued. \n\nHope that makes sense.",

If you do want to try picking individual stocks I would say knowing how to read a balance sheet, income statements...etc is 100% needed. The Intellegent Investor book will take you through all of that, with some admittedly dated examples. It was written by Warren Buffets mentor in the 30's or 40's and updated in the 90's or 2000's. Though honestly, going to a companies investor relations page and reading their presentations and quarterly filings (10Q/K) with judicious use of google can teach you a lot as well. \n\nAs for your other question, I feel like a lot of people discount being able to read balance sheets because they don't know the accounting behind them. If you learn enough to recognize what they actually are, I feel like it can be a huge help in come cases. That said, sure some companies are asset light, or are able to make most of their money off of intangibles, and in those cases the balance sheet may very well not help much at all. Its also important to be able to read income statements, as many times one off factors can make a companies PE ratio seem very high or low, and if you don't know how to read income statements or look at their actual quarterly reports you may not know what their earnings actually are.\n\n What buffet was referring to is being able to understand the business itself, for example, as a 90 year old man, buffet had zero chance at being able to understand why google would be worth more as a search engine than say yahoo or aol. I think he would admit this too, sure he could have bought google or apple if he took a chance, but he just as easily could have bought [pets.com](http://pets.com) or cisco during the bubble. He means that don't invest in companies that you can't understand how they make their money, what stops competitors from copying them, stuff like that. For a person who works as a software engineer who has no knowledge of banks or what makes a particular bank a good bank or another a bad one, it makes no sense for them to try to pick bank stocks, and it might be a much better idea for them to focus somewhere else, or learn first. \n\nI'm no expert myself though and thats just my own rambling 2c.",

Of course, the next best thing to that is investing in BRK.B (I'm guessing you can't afford BRK.A).\n\nApart from that, individual stocks is a risky investing strategy unless you're talking about short-term trading (which is also risky, but the company's underlying fundamentals are less important). The trouble with it is that it is very difficult to diversify unless you have a large amount of money to work with; diversification is important because you will make mistakes and you don't want one bad pick (or, more likely, bad decision) to wipe out your portfolio.\n\nP/E only really matters in the context of what that company historically trades at; there isn't one universal number that applies to everything. So, talking about RR, a P/E of 19 is only low if RR generally trades at a higher multiple. \n\nAnother thing you can look at is dividend yields; a higher-than-average dividend yield on an otherwise healthy company can indicate that it is undervalued. There is even a strategy surrounding this idea called \"Dogs of the Dow\" where you simply take whatever money you have to invest and divide it evenly between the 10 companies of the Dow 30 with the highest dividend yields, reallocating annually. I think there is even an ETF that will do this for you.\n\nThe other important thing to know is when to get out.

Some of those tobacco companies are fairly leveraged already. \n\nIf you do choose to lever up (I dont recommend) don\u2019t actually maximize your leverage, lever up like 10% of the portfolio and have a portion of the portfolio in some just below investment grade bond funds.

Today, it dropped 8%, and in the spirit of learning more about what I don't know, I was trying to figure out......why?\n\n\n\nThere are no google news results for CTRN, no SEC filings, no change in analyst opinion...seemingly nothing to give anyone reason to believe it was suddenly in trouble.\n\n\n\nSimilar industry stocks like TJX Companies (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Burlington Stores (BURL), seem to have done just fine as well, so no new industry news I assume.\n\n\n\nIt happened fast too: opening at 19.59 it was 19 by 10:30, 18.56 by 11:00, and 18.30 by 11:30\n\n\n\nIt closed at 18.04.\n\n\n\nSo, this leads me to believe it was one big trade offloading their shares, or some automated algorithms feeding off each other..\n\n\n\nBut I do not know how to confirm that.\n\n1. No insider trades that I can find\n2. No institutional changes\n3. Technical sentiment has been bearish for a while so I assume no big indicators changed today (but didn't go check them all)\n\n\n\nWhat do you think, do you agree it was a big institutional change or automated trading? Do you know how to check that? Did you find something I missed that would explain the desire to sell?",

Also, if you\u2019re into podcasts, ignore the long ones, you\u2019re better off customizing your own education routine\u2014pick 1 or 2 that you can spend less than 10 min listening to daily. That in mind:\n\n\n- Finviz news is good for quickly scanning headlines\n- Axios Closer emails - Highly recommend due to easy to digest format (general news app is solid too)\n- CNBC on twitter\n- Reuters is great, efficient, and unbiased\n- WSJ - only market specific news, ignore the rest\n- Stockstory gives concise updates on earnings (I use Apple News for it)\n- Bloomberg **newsletter emails**\n- FT headlines, not worth the subscription price though imo\n- Daily Upside emails are o.k.\n- Bloomberg overall is o.k. but has become more sensational recently so I pay less attention to it\n- Chartr emails are nice to look at, bit of a novelty\n- Toggle.ai. emails are o.k., bit of a novelty as well\n- Someone here mentioned Stock Analysis emails, haven\u2019t tried them yet but the concise format checks the box for me\n\nOverall, I would **strongly** advise limiting your total news digestion to less than 10 or 15 min in the morning and perhaps the same or a bit more after mkt close\u2014you\u2019ll want to reserve time for actual stock research or trade management (been doing this for over ten years, please trust me on this lol)\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: Adding my discord server where I share my research, trades, and sources in case you\u2019d like to pop in:\n[Happy Trading Frens](https://discord.gg/bSQYPCUmXE)",

Here's a snippet from the newsletter \\[[https://www.levelfields.ai/newsletter](https://www.levelfields.ai/newsletter)\\] :  \n  \nIt's been a great bull run since the end of 2023, with the S&P 500 posting huge gains. Until recently, there's been little fear of a major stock pullback. The last two weeks, volatility crept back into the market, causing huge swings in popular stocks. So here's what's happened behind the scenes: Computer-driven macro hedge funds\u00a0[**sold**](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01J3XD8AT9VM2EYXAZ2XMA1ZDZ_4)\u00a0$20 billion in equities and are set to shed at least more $25 billion over the next week, Morgan Stanley said to institutional clients on Thursday. This is a major selloff and it coincided with other wealth managers trimming positions in stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft that have done really well. Many firms have internal rules preventing them from owning over a certain percentage of their portfolio in any one stock, causing selloffs that can cause market panic from retail investors.",

Add the absurd amount of liquidity to the picture and you end up with the classic corporate organization, full of middle managers, politics, senior staff that \"copy and paste\" numbers from one excel to another. When the management realizes that productivity is falling they hire junior staff that usually do the work of 3 seniors, but with less than one third of their salary. Yet you can't fire those old mammoths, so you hope they take up early retirement, but eventually they remain, kicking the can one day after the other.

        "post_body": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI'm really trying to get into level 200 investing here, and enjoying every minute of it. I just finished \"One Up On Wall Street\" and one ratio really stuck out to me that I've been using to analyze stocks \u2014 to quote from his book (pg. 199):\n\n>\"A slightly more complicated formula enables us to compare growth rates to earnings, while also taking the dividends into account. Find the long term growth rate, add the dividend yield, and divide by the P/E ratio. Less than 1 is poor, 1.5 is okay, but what you're really looking for is a 2 or better. A company with a 15 percent growth rate, a 3 percent dividend, and a p/e of 6 would have a fabulous 3\".\n\nI've found a company that apparently has a 13.8 according to this formula, but it has to be user error or some other assumption I'm just overlooking. I'm hoping someone here can help me read between the lines.\n\nThis company has the following numbers:\n\n|Year|Net Income Growth|Dividend Growth|P/E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2023|664.02%|N/A|19.3|\n|2022|-80.81%|N/A||\n|2021|-17.81%|N/A||\n|2020|897.00%|N/A||\n|2019|-129.68%|N/A||\n\nSo, I took the average Net Income growth which is 266% + 0 (Dividend) and divided by P/E of 19.3 = 13.8\n\nObviously the lumpy NI growth is a cause for concern, but the narrative I have built around this company helps me personally get over that concern. Other than that though, **what obvious mistakes or flaws could this introduce. One thought I have is, should I be using EBITDA instead of Net Income in the numerator?**\n\nThe other ratios I've looked at for this company are:\n\nYield @ 5.09% | ROIC @ 24% | Return on Cash @ 2.15% | Cash Position is Growing | PEG is .03 | Net Debt is -23M\n\nOther than the return on cash and yield being low right now, It just seems like a slam dunk...from a Peter Lynch numbers perspective, but curious how anyone would tackle this differently.",

Debt isn\u2019t bad if you receive $40 billion today and can earn an annual return of over 4.6% on that cash, but it seems like WBD has more than a comfortable level of debt from the AT&T breakup. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense for an individual to purchase cars they don\u2019t need just because it\u2019s at a low rate and the debt will inflate away. I know that WBD can earn a better return on capital than an individual, but if they weren\u2019t concerned about their debt level they wouldn\u2019t be aggressively paying it down. The main thing is if you have $40 billion in debt you still owe $40 billion plus interest and it\u2019s your responsibility to use inflation to beat that interest rate significantly.",

Additionally, Zaslov's compensation is mainly driven by increasing FCF.   It'll often take 2-4 years for the changes to have full effect, but he's made some excellent changes to operations in the last two years that should increase profitability (and FCF).\n\nThey can retire the debt three ways.  1) Pay it out over the regular expected schedule when that instrument was initially sold.  2) Pay off debt early.  This could be outright or as part of a rescheduling once rates have come down.  3) Buy it back off the market.  While the Fed rates are up, it drives down the cost to buy back and extinguish instruments that have lower rates than the Fed rates.  You'll notice that they've been buying back debt lately that fits this later description.    \n\nAs of the end of March, WBD had reduced debt by $10bn since the IPO ($53bn to $43bn).  That is a great rate of debt reduction and it makes further progress easier.  August 7th will give us an update, and I won't be surprised if it is under $40bn at that time given some hints that have been floating around.

All other dates pull from that, and all estimates are as of that date.  For example, if I set the effective date to 6/12/2018, then the current year is 2018, next year is 2019, and consensus next year revenue is consensus for 2019 as of 6/12/2018.\n\nI originally started doing this so that I could build \u201cscores\u201d into the screen and backtest them.  For example, one of my screens assigned a score of 0 to 10 for \u201cquality\u201d, another for \u201cgrowth\u201d, another for \u201cvalue\u201d, another for \u201cchange\u201d, and finally a composite score.  The screen constructed a portfolio from the top-scoring names, calculated the return of that portfolio over the following one year, and compared that to a benchmark index\u2019s return.   So I could modify the scoring formulas and see how well the screen would have worked in the past.  I built these for specific sectors and industries, rather than using one screen across sectors.\n\nThis was very useful, and still is, even though I never took the approach to a \u201cquant shop\u201d level - at heart, I\u2019ve always been a manual stock picking type. Today I don\u2019t do the back-testing but just use the scores to narrow down what stocks I\u2019m going to spend time manually working on.  \n\nI don\u2019t know of a readily accessible commercial tool to do this, and would be very interested to hear of any.",

They minimize their credit risk by requiring cash down (probably some % of each sale) from the loan originators (merchants) that will be used to cover losses should a loan go 90 days delinquent. Sounds good for the bank, and it is, but it's kind of unclear to me what's in it for the merchants as opposed to BNPL or bank loans. Here are my thoughts: \n\nThe loans can apparently be used for larger purchases such as for home improvements or by small businesses, which I imagine you can't simply use Klarna or Afterpay for (they probably have some transaction limit and target a completely different market of goods and sellers), which would be an obvious benefit and net gain for VersaBank's p-o-s partners as they get to sell more. Moreover, the clear advantage over a typical bank loan for larger purchases is the hassle of getting it, while VersaBank's financing is available at check out and with instant credit assessment (as well as heavily reduced credit risk with the aforementioned method). No need to have even heard of the bank ahead of time.\n\nI've emailed their investor relations to ask this question or where I can read more about what actually makes it attractive to their business partners.\n\nI do get the same sketch vibes from the website, but we should consider that this is not a customer facing business. It is a B2B bank. But yeah, it's weird that they don't go into detail about how they function since they have obviously structured themselves differently from the industry standard and are so proud of it.

If you thought the website looked sketchy now, you should have seen a few months ago BEFORE the news of the US expansion, it looked like some teenager had made it, lol.  If you can find an archived version of it, you should go look at it just for a laugh.  It was one of the main reasons I went digging far more in depth once I learned about this company because I felt sketch vibes at first too.\n  \nIn terms of the POS financing, my understanding is that it is largely tied to home improvement/HVAC purchases.  One of the reasons this is a hot market in Canada right now is due to government programs.  Canada offers an interest free loan program for upgrades that improve energy efficiency in your home.  The downside to this program is that you must pay for the upgrades up front BEFORE you get your loan which makes some upgrade inaccessible to many people.  So if you can POS loan for these services to \"tide you over\" until you can get your government loan, this helps you achieve your goal in taking advantage of the government program.  That's just one piece of it.  The other is just that HVAC is one of those \"must pay\" situations if say your furnance goes.  You can't really put it off in the middle of winter so financing is a necessity for many and if they offer it during the emergency call, well, some just can't turn it down.  My other understanding of why they limit some info on the POS financing tech is that they have some kind of proprietary design for it and my feeling is that they don't want to divulge too much about it but I could be speaking out my ass on that one.  \n  \nThey also handle insolvency deposits.  I have confirmed that they handle most of the accounts for MNP Debt (which is Canada's largest insolvency firm).  So pretty legit there.  \n  \nAs I stated in my other comment, the banking industry in Canada is very heavily regulated.  Much more so than in the US.  It's part of the reason why our banks did not suffer so badly during many of the same financial crises that the US experienced but also part of the reason why our banking industry is basically an oligopoly as well with very little competition.  My opinion is that if Versabank is a chartered bank in Canada, then they are being run reputably and under pretty great scrutiny.  \n  \nTo me, the greatest risk is their model absolutely tanking in the US for some reason and having all that effort and investment be in vain and ultimately end up costing them.  But I feel this is mitigated by the fact that they are constantly pitching in the US and have been for years and that they already have customers in the wings if you believe what they're saying.  \n  \nLastly, look at some of their staff if you \"feel\" they are sketchy.  The head of DRT Cyber used to be the Principal Architect of Cyber Security at Blackberry.  One of Versabank's recent board appointments literally used to be the Director General of Finance Canada's Banking department.  \n  \nEDIT: Another point to consider....I see them as a possible candidate for a buyout in the future though I think the CEO of VBNK is adamantly against it IMO.  As I stated, the Canadian Banking industry is an oligopoly.  Banks that tend to be on the up and up get eaten up by the \"big banks\" we have here.  Look at Canadian Western Bank as a recent example.  Very good if you took a shot at them and bought in at their lows before they were being bought out.",

        "post_date": "2024-07-31T09:20:48",
        "post_body": "20 month TSR: 68-70%, exit price 46 CAD + \\~1ish CAD in next 7 quarter dividends.\n\n**Here goes my ramble.... Hope you guys find it interesting and do give some feedback.**\n\nPet Valu is a pet retail store public since 21 in Canada. It's an omnichannel franchise-driven retail business with 72% of all stores under franchise. Now this is since 2020, \\~40% EPS compounded, and as my base can continue to be a 20% EPS compounded in the future available at less than 17 times. (My second biggest bet after FTDR, before BLBD and EMN).\n\n Pet value is usually the co-leaser or sub-leaser for the units that house these stores (franchise). Online sales are shared between stores. Pet Valu most importantly acts as a wholesale arm to these stores, which in turn pay \\~6% of sales back to Pet Valu.\n\nThe Canadian pet industry is a recession resilient above GDP growth market. This means in a downward economic cycle Pet Valu kept (volume and price each) positive (unlike other retail businesses). **It yet still thrives from market share gains in a Canadian pet market, where spending at 2023 price levels has compounded at \\~7.5% CAGR from 2015.** The pet population has only compounded at a \\~0.5% indicating a long-term premiumization tailwind (Statista). There are approximately 9 million households in Canada with pets, 28.1 mil pets including fish in 21 vs 27.5 in 2016.\n\n  \n**Investment Thesis Summary (Just read this if you don\u2019t have enough time, if you want to read more I'm attaching my blog link, do check out in-depth there with my model and chart)**\n\n1. **Pet consumption is niche, pet valu\u2019s model works, and we can continue expecting market share gains in a \\~7-8% volume CAGR market**\n\nA bit more color: Pet Valu works because of 2 things, great experience in-store (30% of online purchases choose in-store delivery despite free delivery after 49 CAD) due to a franchise model run by entrepreneurs, and a phenomenal supply chain (90% of franchise goods are purchased from Pet Valu wholesale totally optional) = supply specific specialty products people actually care about at cheaper rates than most comps (vs cheap food products that people don't want supplying by comps at cheap rates). Moreoever, rest of industry has taken more pricing on premium products due to supply chain mgmgt (Pet Valu double digit volume only same store sales growth but no incremental market share because fragmented players take extreme price, Pet Valu hasn't exceeded 6% in avg ticket per transaction) Given this **6% same stores sales growth as base normalized forward vs double digit 20 - 22 and 5%+ in 23** isn't impractical. They only cover 75% of Canada within a 5km radius creating an opportunity for at least 250 stores (200 stores over next 5 years my assumption in line with mgmt). Lastly, their is really strong In conclusion, a good supply chain + great customer service driven by a franchise model is very successful and difficult to imitate overnight.\n\nThere is some more data in my blog covering membership numbers and loyalty numbers that are indicative of superior data in terms of penetration and % of loyal members contributing to sales (both superior to US's golden pet boy, chewy) \n\n  \n2. **Acquisition tailwinds and new franchises create incremental growth opportunities to same-store sales**\n\nLet me break down some store-level unit economics for you. Franchise stores on average will do 2 million CAD a year on an average 3750 4-wall square feet model. Now extrapolating from comps (and some other internal numbers), they'll do approximately 40 - 42% GM (Pre royalty fees), which implies a COGS worth roughly 1.18 million CAD. 90% of this is from the Pet Valu wholesale business (\\~47 - 48% of biz biggest component). This means roughly a 53% contribution of franchise sales (Estimated) to wholesale revenue, which was the case until 21. Then....\n\nPet Valu acquired Chico on Feb 22 (Quebec specialty leading pet franchise retail, 100% franchise), 66 stores, by year-end grew to 82 and by 23 to 87. These were obviously on the exclusive wholesale network (so diluted it down to sub 48%). I talked to a prospective applicant and he confirmed that any Pet Valu franchise inquiry for Quebec is directed only to Chico. Moreover, Pet Valu is on 6% royalty, chico is on 2% royalty, royalties and sub lease revenue (another component) % of estimated franchise sales have also gone down. I think the market has severely underestimated their supply chain value, as new and existing owners would gladly accept higher terms (Chico I am talking about). (Charts on the blog to assist you in understanding all this)\n\n  \n**Thesis 3: Recent margin compression is not due to industry problems but new DCs**\n\nPet Valu has gone severely over capacity and had to rely on 3 3PL (3 party logistics) in Toronto, one in Calgary, and one in Vancouver beyond their legacy DCs (Distribution centers) in Toronto and Vancouver. Legacy DCs have little automation + 3PLs were more inefficient, almost handpicking. Now they were paying 20 million (1.9% of 2023 sales) in step-up and occupancy costs (along with increase ROU depreciation lease related). But they will only start using these new facilities from Q2 of this year (which means it has started) for new GTA DC, Vancouver DC from the end of this year. Excluding COGS D&A, this means a simple 90bps improvement in COGS each year. \n\n  \n**Thesis 4: Franchise + wholesale business (Low asset business + cash cow)**\n\nROICS, 30%+ and normalized ROE (forward basis with 2x ish Financial leverage in DuPont), 30%+, comps nowhere even close. It's because you are the wholesale supplier to your franchises, for little investment you get all the sales (co-sharing some lease cost). \n\n**Valuation and risks**\n\nExtrapolating from my DCF, comps, itself history, I think NTM P/E of 18.0x or trailing of 23.0x is an appropriate exit multiple (historical since IPO average is 22 and 25 corresponding). I land at a base case EPS of 1.87 CAD in 25 and 2.31 CAD in 26. Applying that I get a price target of 46 CAD + \\~ 1 CAD in dividends (+ no share buyback beyond FY 24 as FY 24 they have an authorised NCIB for purchasing 2.5% of common outstanding shares).\n\nBear Case (Recession), same-store sales growth 3%, forward 14x (trough multiples ish), \\~30 CAD + some dividends, so you are breaking even\n\nBull Case (Double-digit same-store sales and average multiple): \\~60 CAD exit + more dividends in 20 months\n\n**Strong risk asymmetry** \n\n[https://multibaggerlovers.blogspot.com/2024/07/pet-valu-holding-tse-pet-40-historical.html](https://multibaggerlovers.blogspot.com/2024/07/pet-valu-holding-tse-pet-40-historical.html) (Blog) \n\n([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11TebprI-6lYI4yfuTR7p-f1FGQ7Hw7Z1/edit?usp=drive\\_link&ouid=100501050702536154043&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11TebprI-6lYI4yfuTR7p-f1FGQ7Hw7Z1/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100501050702536154043&rtpof=true&sd=true))\u00a0\u00a0(Model)",

So there is a consumer slowdown (possibly), but this is an easy compounded given two uncorrelated triggers with the economic cycle. Acquisition related tailwinds (Pet valu supplied 90% of items for franchisees, not yet for a new company they acquired plus franchise royalty normalisations). GM% related, new DC ready so they don't have to pay rents for 2x facilities. Lot of triggers, great strategy, phenomenal returns and units economics at a cheap valuation\n\nTop-down (Answering your industry thing): This is **above GDP growth recession resilient business**. Over 75% of the business is food related (with strong premiumization driven trends by awareness of better quality food). This has compounded at 8.5% volume (not price only volume) since 2015. So this isn't really a **discretionary** like ur imaging (a staples with strong compounding growth). Plus since its above GDP in a good cycle, from customer upgrades, more visits for discretionaries (you still get very strong incremental growth compared to other consumers). Industry-wise you get the both of best worlds, where most companies are cheap today relative to history. Sure in 2 quarters they may get cheaper or not idk, but on a normalised basis, its very attractive today.",

        "post_body": "Hi everyone, I hope everyone is having a wonderful summer. I am trying to estimate equity value of an automotive company, and I think the best way to approach this is using net replacement value of assets. The idea, as always, is to go through the balance sheet one by one and adjust book value of assets/liabilities so as to estimate what a new entrant would have to pay to replace the assets. \n\nThe difficulty I run into when I think about how best to apply this approach to an automotive giant is that:\n\n(a) Like most other peers, the company has a financing unit, which is arguably an entirely different business from designing and manufacturing cars  \n(b) The company breaks down its entire balance sheet by segment, which is very helpful for what I am trying to do, but alongside the main segments they report \"intersegmental transactions\" which in some lines are very substantial amounts, and I am not entirely sure how to even start treating this  \n(c) the company a stake in a unit that it recently deconsolidated leading to a number of curious depreciation charges popping up on its income statement\n\nMy question to the lovely audience here is: has anyone tried this approach with an automotive company before, and if so, could you share some pointers? Or perhaps you guys have seen in the depths of the internet an example of a similar exercise, in which case I would be so grateful if you could share some resources.\n\nI am happy to get a discussion going and hopefully together we can learn something :)",

Also it\u2019s not like global auto demand is meaningfully growing (opposite probs more likely) so it\u2019s not like there will be a shortage of auto production capacity.\n\nIf you tried looking at liquidation value that would probably be a pittance vs equity value.\n\nFor valuation in general I would think about what is the approach that makes the most sense given the company and situation. Replacement value is rarely the most relevant. For an auto co I\u2019d probably do a sum of the parts analysis using operating profit for the non financial stuff and then look at the finance arm using earnings or book value. Also don\u2019t forget to ding for any relevant financial liabilities, e.g. underfunded pension",

I looked a bit more into it and I agree a SOTP is the best approach here.\n\nJust to be sure (and if you have the time), want to ask this follow up:\n\n- The idea is to come up with some multiple we think is fair for the company\u2019s EBIT and then arrive at the EV of its core business. My question is, given that we have a segmental breakdown of the balance sheet, surely here we would only use the cash and liabilities of the core business, ignoring anything to do with the financing arm? We would also exclude anything to do with stakes in listed assets, if any such cash or liabilities is included in the core business reporting, if we plan to add them at market value going forward right? Also struggling to think how I would treat inter-segment liabilities: could we omit any special work on those sine the company says they are carried out on near-market terms? \n\n- We then add net assets (book value) of the financing business so that should take care of any remaining liabilities that we haven\u2019t covered. I\u2019m quite comfortable with taking BV here, I\u2019ve seen it done before including recently on VIC. \n\nThanks again for taking the time to answer my original question and if you have the time to address any of the points above would be much appreciated.",

Look at the trend line over several years. Is the company going to be more or less profitable in 5 years. Develop a baseline scenario with napkin math. How many billion they will make in 5 years?

They are very helpful when you are trying to separate the good from the biased advice.\n\nIf you want to approach the world of investing scientifically sound, the consensus is that you should invest passively in a worldwide diversified index fund. Its less fun, but statistically you are going to be ahead of at least 90% of investors. For American Investors this would be for example an investment in $VT , this does not only diversify broadly around industries but around the whole world. The idea is that the industries and countries with the highest performance will have the highest weight in this index and hence you participate in the overall market. Everything else is just speculation on assumptions that are not in your control. The market is a chaotic system that can not be predicted and therefore should be invested passively.\n\nIf you think you are better than 90% investors, or treat investing as a hobby, i recommend looking at Stanley Druckenmiller, Howard Marks, Seth Klarman etc. If you want to diversify with real estate i can recommend seeking alpha and Jussi Askola / High yield landlord.",
