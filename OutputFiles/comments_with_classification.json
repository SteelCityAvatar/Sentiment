I want to start a position but haven't completed the dive through the Financials. \n\nHighlights:\nRev growth ~35\nGross margin ~35\nCurrent Assets ~2x+ current liabilities\nAssets ~3x liabilities\nInventories and expenses aren't showing anything concerning imo. Seem in line with the previous year on a linear level.\nLeases, among other expenses, don't show concern.\n\nP/E is at 37ish, and CNBC shows fwd P/E at a similar number. I'm not sure that's accurate considering the growth and margins number. \n\nMarket cap at 1.6b\n\nStock dilution looks like another 2 million shares out in warrants if I'm not mistaken. That should equate to around 5% dilution in the coming years. Somebody correct me if I'm missing something.\n\nBird flu hasn't had an impact on sales/margins according to their presentation.\n\nOverall, it seems like a solid company with a lot of growth. I've been loving their eggs as a consumer and only recently discovered they were public. \n\nPoint being, their eggs are fantastic (taste, richer, texture, etc) compared to your generic nutrientless white eggs you get. I can not go back to cheap white eggs. I know the difference now lol\n\nThey are much more expensive, so this really targets a bit higher than low income. \n\nI'm going to start scaling into this company and hope they have a major pullback in price for reasons that don't have anything to do with fundamentals (market wide pullback, etc).\n\nWho else has looked into this? Valuation is rich, but it also seems high quality from a fundamental standpoint, so it'll naturally command a slightly higher premium, but I still would rather DCA.",

I look at VITL as follows. \n\n$1 billion in 2027 revenue (Management's goal, which they have a history of exceeding).\n\n10% profit margin (about where it is today)\n\n$100 million in profit. \n\nThrow a 20x on that,\n\nIt's a $2 billion company (currently $1.6 billion)\n\nAbout a 25% gain over 3 years from current prices. \n\nAt $1 billion market cap (about $25/share)\n\nThe math works out better. 100% gain in 3 years is excellent. \n\nI think there's also opportunity to increase their profit margins going forward. CALM actually has a higher profit margin, but VITL is spending on Capex right now too.",
