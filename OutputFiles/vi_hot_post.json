I've got my eye on a few value plays that seem promising.\n\nFirst up, I'm watching WBA closely. They've been beaten down lately, but their fundamentals still look solid. With the recent management shakeup, there might be some positive changes coming.\n\nAlso keeping tabs on some energy stocks. With all the geopolitical tension, oil prices could spike, and some of these undervalued energy companies might see a nice bump.\n\nAnyone else spotting any good value opportunities out there? Always keen to hear what others are seeing in the market.\n\nHappy hunting, value investors!",

The theory argues that a company\u2019s ability to earn profit and grow determines a company\u2019s market value and drives the stock price.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendirrelevance.asp\n\nI actually don't believe this, or at least, that is not true in all cases\n\nI'm holding one company, Vienna Insurance Group, which has an uncommonly low payout ratio, typically 30-50%, compared to the 60%-80% which would be typical amongst their peers. And the stock trades at a much lower multiple, approximately proportionate to the lower payout. I can't see any reason for why this should be the case aside from the low dividend. I think the market does actually care about the payout. If there was no payout at all, then I think the stock price/multiple would be even lower\n\nCurious what other value investors think",

Look at the actual assumptions from the Miller Modigliani paper:\n\n\"For this argument to work, in addition to assuming that there is no tax advantage or disadvantage associated with dividends, we also have to assume the following:\n\n1l) There are no transaction costs associated with converting price appreciation into cash by selling stock. If this were\u00a0not\u00a0true, investors who need cash urgently might prefer to receive dividends.\n\n2)Firms that pay too much in dividends can issue stock, again with no flotation or transaction costs, to take on good projects. There is also an implicit assumption that this stock is fairly priced.\n\n3) The investment decisions of the firm are unaffected by its dividend decisions, and the firm's operating cash flows are the same no matter which dividend policy is adopted.\n\n4) Managers of firms that pay too little in dividends do not waste the cash pursuing their own interests (i.e., managers with large free cash flows do not use them to take on bad projects).\"\n\nSo, basically, Efficient Market Theory is baked in the assumptions, when they assume that selling 1$ of stock for you is equivalent to receive 1$ of dividends. Number 4 is also dumb.\n\nSource: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/invfables/dividirrelevance.htm",

Sometimes the company does this when the share price is lower. \n\nLet\u2019s use Boeing as an example.  Boeing bought shares back at all sorts of prices. Most of them higher than the current price. \n\nNow they are issuing 10B in new shares at market (currently 150ish). This company has a market cap of 95B. So they are diluting their shares by 10%. Meaning the shares are now worth 135.  Ohh but wait. They also just have introduced new debt, up to 25B. Meaning their value just dropped by about 20-25%. \n\nThe same company also paid dividends. At least with the dividends the shareholders were able to get cash out. \n\nIf this were a smaller company, the question is: do you want to buy out your partners (stock buy back), or do you want to withdraw cash (dividends)?   I prefer to withdraw cash. It has less risk for me. \n\nAlso, none of these actions should be taken while the company has significant short term debt. Especially if that short term debt is revolving.

Despite challenges from cyclical demand and geopolitical risks, I expect ASML\u2019s ability to innovate and provide critical systems for advanced chipmaking positions it well for future growth. For long-term investors, ASML offers a compelling opportunity due to its dominance in a high-demand industry. Strong financial performance. Their role in the semiconductor value chain is crucial, and its strategic importance will only grow as the world continues to rely on more advanced technology.\n\nCurrently trading below its 5-year averages and more than 30% below [**my fair price estimate**](https://res.cloudinary.com/diordpspg/image/upload/v1729413111/asml-fair-price_kqr4mg.png) (PNG, 300KB).\n\n**Company Profile**\n\nThe leader in photolithography systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors.

This is a big range and one that was just downgraded by quite a bit.\nTBH I think they are currently fairly priced, and could be 10-20% higher 1 year from now. But they just had a massive disappointment in earnings, and we could get more bad news before we get good news.\n\nSo yea, it could be a great long term investment, but at the current price I personally see too much risk in them continuing to fall in the short term. They very well could fall another 20-30%. If they do, then at that point I would consider buying. But I wouldn\u2019t consider buying a fairly priced company with short term risk\n\nEdit: regarding short term risks and their disappointing earnings, it has to do with the US chip act and sales to china. There are various articles about this, but this one scares me a bit.

It's only like 3% of my portfolio, And it's a small bet I made which is psychologically allowing me to play around in the markets without actually touching the main portfolio at all. Made about 17% on it since I purchased it at the rate high point, Plus about 4.2% interest because It has that positive carry of the coupon. The whole purpose of it was to get that positive carry And hopefully enjoy some price appreciation as rates normalized, And then sell it the next time there is a credit-induced market crash. The thinking there is that it's most negatively correlated to small cap value which I have quite a bit of. SCV has high beta which means it's very volatile and tends to crash harder in a recession, especially a credit driven one, And then it rebounds faster than other sectors out of it. Long dated treasuries are safe assets that would see a bit of a price bump as rates fell and More importantly investors flock to safety.

If the number is 5x, then that doesnt mean it will take the company 5 years to pay down debt because EBITDA is not equal to cash flow. \nThe correct metric to use would be debt/FCF, which is the actual amount of cash that they have available to pay down debt.\n\nAnother thing people use it for is to measure operational performance, but how can you exclude interest for example? I see interest as part of the operations, because the company at one point decided to take on debt to fund their operations.\nAlso EBITDA doesnt take into account CAPEX, which for some companies can be a significant amount. \n\nMaybe I am stupid, but I would love for someone to enlighten me on why EBITDA is a good metric for anything.

The problem is that they\u2019re using a lot of cash for adding inventory and accounts receivables.   If you use free cash flow exclusively then you\u2019ll not appreciate the profitability of the company due to increased cash needs for working capital - which is a temporary situation depending on business needs.   \n\nIn terms of capital structure.  You might have a situation where company has too much debt.  Doesn\u2019t mean company isn\u2019t intrinsically worth anything.  More of a question whether the value accrues to equity or debt holders.   EBITDA is helpful for understanding situation.  \n\nLike any metric, EBITDA is useful when used as a tool in conjunction with other metrics in triangulating to figure out situation.   So yes EBITDA has issues but it\u2019s one part of an analysis and one shouldn\u2019t discount it because it isn\u2019t perfect.  Otherwise in isolation pretty much all of the economic measurements have issues and you wouldn\u2019t have anything to use at all!   Just know how to use it.  \n\nAdjusted EBITDA.   Good luck just listening to management.  Some adjustments are reasonable.  Most aren\u2019t.  Just understand what the adjusted EBITDA is and run your own.  Management makes their case what metric you should use.  Doesn\u2019t mean you should use it as is!   I swear people are way too simplistic in just making something binary.

You need ratios like price /earnings etc.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThis years good FCF does not guarantee next years as it depends on more discrete factors.

EBITDA doesn't make sense for high debt or high capex companies. \n\nTo make matters worse, EBITDA has been stretched to 'adjusted' EBITDA, where management uses their discretion to remove non-cash but actual costs (such as share based compensation) from EBITDA.",

You say EBITDA doesnt work well for companies with lots of debt. Why is that? \nReits have a lot of debt, but I think EBITDA for reits is okay. Because they own a lot of properties, that depreciate according to GAAP, but in reality the properties dont really lose value. In many cases the value goes up with inflation, so it makes sense to add it back in for reits.",

As an investor if you buy the whole business today, and if share based compensation is diluting the share count by 5%, next year you only own 95% of the business. So its a real cost to the shareholder.    \nQ2: Considering that you are using EBITDA as a proxy for real earnings (or free cash flows), EBITDA doesn't work for REITs, because interest and capex are real, cash expenses, Depreciation being non-cash expense holds true only if the REIT has zero maintenance capex (which is unlikely). The best way to test this is to compare EBITDA v. the pre-tax free cash flow (i.e. cash flow from operating activities add tax paid less maintenance capex) and see if the EBITDA number translates fully into pre-tax FCF. If it does, what you are saying is right. Otherwise I get an upvote :)",

By briefly looking at them: \n\n**[BMEA](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/BMEA)**\u2019s financials look quite bad. No revenue and earnings/free cash flow. It looks like a holding company that no cash is being passed to.\n\n**[VSTM](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/VSTM)** has lost 98% of its value over the lifetime of the stock. For a good reason as financials are abismal - altough not as bad as above. \n\n**[SGMT](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/SGMT)** also has terrible financials. 0 revenue, inconsistent fcf, odd balance sheet. Many red flags. \n\nBottom line: if I were you, I would allocate my hard earned money elsewhere. \n\nSorry for being so tough. The most important thing you can do as a value/long term investor is to look at all the facts and take a logical conclusion on a company.

Right now, I'm looking to [VRE.TO](http://VRE.TO), [VCN.TO](http://VCN.TO), [VIU.TO](http://VIU.TO), [VAB.TO](http://VAB.TO), [VFV.TO](http://VFV.TO) (I'm a Canadian investor). I've split the portfolio into these percentages: VCN at 20%; VFV at 50%; VIU at 5%; VAB at 15; VRE at 10%. From reading The Intelligent Investor, it seems the best course of action is 70% in index funds both the CAD and US indexes. And then for inflation, I put in a REIT index and then they suggested bonds in there too, so I put in 15% in bonds. Also, there was mention that diversifying into international markets may help as well, so I put in 5%. So, all told, my contributions each year would be $6,500 and I plan on holding these for a very long time. Through Wealthsimple, there's no commission fees, I'm reinvesting the dividends through Wealthsimple's DRIP and they allow for fractional shares so I can start with little upfront.\n\n  \nHow's this plan so far?

        "post_title": "NGVT \u2013 A cyclical company now at its lowest price since 2016.",
        "post_date": "2024-10-20T12:01:30",
        "post_body": "The stock price has decreased by 26% this year, reaching its all-time lows. I think this presents a great opportunity for a swing trade in a cyclical stock. Here\u2019s why:\n\nIngevity Corp is an American company that operates in two segments: performance materials and performance chemicals. In the performance materials segment, it produces chemicals for vapor emission control systems in cars, which help decrease CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Within the performance chemicals sector, Ingevity has further divisions, including the construction segment, which primarily produces chemicals used in pavement construction. The other division, called industrial specialties, manufactures chemicals used in paper and ink.\n\nThe EBITDA for performance chemicals has alarmingly decreased by 80% when comparing Q2 2024 to Q2 2023. The margins fell from 15% to 5%. This decline was mainly attributed to low margins in industrial specialties and the closure of two industrial facilities. Still, I believe that due to pavement being the dominant product, along with lower interest rates and increasing home construction, there will be a positive effect in the upcoming quarter.\n\n* [https://imgur.com/a/hBdMd9T](https://imgur.com/a/hBdMd9T) - Comparison of revenues for NGVT (blue line) and total construction of pavements and highways (red line) over the last three months. For the last 2 months, the construction spending has increased by 2 billion!\n\n**Predictions:** I anticipate tailwinds in the sector, mainly attributed to lower interest rates and increased construction spending in 2025. It is already known that highway and pavement construction in Q3 2024 is at an all-time high, suggesting that Ingevity's Q3 earnings could see an increase in EBITDA from the construction segment. Furthermore NATGAS price is for the last 3 months stagnant and therefore cost should not be high.\n\n**Performance Materials:**\n\n* [https://imgur.com/iO9JALa](https://imgur.com/iO9JALa) - NGVT revenue (blue line) vs. total automobile sales (TOTALSE).\n\nEBITDA from performance materials has increased by 28%, primarily due to lower costs. The automobile industry is currently showing no growth, but this could change with the fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, the primary commodity needed for chemicals, sawdust, has remained stable, so I don\u2019t expect any increases in costs for the performance materials sector.\n\n**The Elephant in the Room:** \n\n**Debt** Ingevity has $1.4 billion in long-term debt and only $0.1 billion in cash. Currently, the company is reducing CAPEX by cutting off its lower-margin business, and its debt has decreased by $1 billion during the trailing twelve months (TTM).\n\n**Net Income Loss:** Due to shutting down its facilities and a goodwill impairment charge, the net income for 2024 is negative, at -$330 million. However, the majority of this loss is attributed to the goodwill change, and therefore, it doesn\u2019t significantly impact financial stability. Without these influences, the adjusted net income is $50.9 million.\n\n**Conclusion:** NGVT currently has a market cap of $1.26 billion. I believe that net income could range between $100 million and $150 million, and that the stock price could increase by 10% after the earnings report primarly based on the sources of FRED database taken from this website: [stocks-fred.com](http://stocks-fred.com) .\n\n  \n- not a financial advice. Still new to value investing so I welcome any feedback. Thanks for the reading!\n\n",

        "post_body": "Hey everyone!\n\nI got tired of manually digging through SEC filings and investor presentations to collect company-specific metrics for my models. So I built Captide. I need your honest feedback.\n\nWe parse regulatory filings, transcripts, and presentations to let you create proprietary datasets using natural language queries for each row/column (with all metrics available, even if not standard). These datasets easily connect to Excel or Python and stay updated with the latest reports. You can also create automated briefings to process qualitative information in those documents or to perform industry analysis at scale. The good thing is that all metrics and insights are auditable to the original docs.\n\nWe see the platform being used like this, but open to hear new perspectives:\n\n1. Before earnings season: Users create proprietary datasets with the financial data needed in their DCFs. Plus, they create custom briefings with the key questions they care about (changes in financials, risk factors, management sentiment, ...)\n2. Once earnings drop: The automated briefing, configured in advance, is delivered via email with all the essential insights. Minutes later, the financial models are updated with the latest data as they are connected to the user's custom dataset.\n3. Scale analysis: You can design briefing or dataset templates to apply across multiple companies, scaling your coverage and filtering results based on your specific qualitative or quantitative criteria.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts and would love feedback from the community. We just opened our beta to the public, so would love to start onboarding anyone that is interested.\n\nLink:\u00a0[www.captide.co](http://www.captide.co/)",

But lately I've been seeing a lot of hedge funds loading up massively on $GOOG/$GOOGL shares and it's made me revisit the company. \n\n  \nI have been spending a lot of time valuating the company. Having reached loads of different margins of safety going from ballpark median price around 170 to 205 worst case, bear case with sub 10% growth. I've read 10-k going back years, different formula, adjusted % within each formula. **The result is always a screaming buy.** \n\nThis one pulls at me because although I believe it is extremely undervalued, having read opinions online everyone around seems to agree. \n\nHowever If everyone believe this is an undervalued company, and have had this sentiment for a year at least. Why aren't we seeing more upwards movement with the share price? It's actually underperformed the S&P500 so far this year. \n\nI hear bear case about AI & the fear of them losing their moat. But I have a hard time thinking they can fall behind on others in the realm of AI with the accumulation of data this company has. \n\nYoutube, waymo, biotech medicine & many more seem to barely ever be included in discussion. Understandably it's a much smaller revenue % than google search, but I believe a lot of those will experience rapid growth in the coming decade. Google products are also used strongly by law enforcement agency. It's become a core component of a lot of jobs. \n\nWhat is everyone missing ? Or what am I specifically missing? ",

It can literally only get better from here, and what would that do for Google? Also google hasn\u2019t been the best capital allocator which raises some concern about their management (like how google is being treated like a retirement home for talented engineers).\n\nIm personally an electrical engineer and have 15% invested in google. So I see more upsides than the down. But the street\u2019s concern is certainly not irrational. The multiple reflects this. And the current multiple is not low.

Google may very well have the lead in the ai race behind the scenes due to their vast amounts of data they collect but don\u2019t want to show all their cards as they don\u2019t know how to monetize it and fear it might destroy their core business.

Google just kind of laughed at them in a \"we know what we're doing\" kind of way. Look how that debate ended up.

Can anyone direct me to a book or website that will help breakdown the information I need to learn without assuming I understand some of the fundamental components or do I just need to go back and learn all of that first? For frame of reference I already have most of my money tied up in VOO because I understand that is one of the safest and smartest plays out there but I want to learn to evaluate stocks better so when I read an article in the Journal or hear a tip or whatever I can do some research on the company\u2019s viability rather than getting excited about the opportunity they seem to have. \n\ntl dr: Not an idiot, not an econ major.

Additionally, I have a 401K that is automatically invested in an agressive fund and has given me great returns so far. I have a few RSUs on top ~$40k that I've not sold for the last three years and my company isn't doing bad either. I am looking for smart ways to invest my $120k.. \n\nFrom what I've been reading, the safest way to invest a lumpsum is in index funds. How do I go about doing this? Most of the top funds I looked up are doing pretty well and I'm unsure of investing a huge amount for potential risks of a correction. Am I better off investing smaller amounts weekly and proportionally larger amounts whenever there are dips? What would be a good general rule to follow? I know that  it's about personal risk tolerance, but I have no idea how to assess mine.\n\n I could, over a year, invest ~$50k if I buy $1000 worth of a mix every week. Or I could invest $25k right away, and invest smaller weekly amounts to reach the same target. Another issue in investing smaller amounts periodically is that I would end up with the same or more cash principle by the end of the year. So I would have just as much or more money in a regular savings account as I have now, potentially missing out on better market returns on that univested cash. \n\nAm I missing out a lot by not investing a larger percentage (let's say $50-60k) in a diversified index fund mix? I would still have that much liquid amount in my HYS, in case everything goes south, and I just have to wait for the market to catch up. \n\nI would also appreciate any suggestions on picking a balanced mix of funds. I have for now picked $FXAIX, $VOO, $GLD, $VTI, $MORN, $BND, $AVUX, $VXUS. \n\nThank you! ",

Look at his ideas - huge part of american equity portfolio is Berkshire (around 30%) and despite that he has overlap with Berkshire: American Express, Bank Of America, Moody's. Another bets are inspired by Monish: Ferrari (via Stellantis spin-off), Micron, Alpha, Arch Resources, Seritage, this company in India with credit rankings. I remember in his books, he was even talking about one of his investment ideas with Bill Ackmann and he told Guy why he shouldn't go into that stock and saved him from a bad bet. I don't think he came up with any interesting ideas by himself. But he is rich - good for him. I wouldn't stick to his fund though, I'd rather invest with Monish or buy and hold Berkshire. You can like Monish or not, but he has generated a ton of his own ideas.  \n  \nHe has some good points about investing and life in general, but listening to him sometimes... it's just painful. He takes awfully long to make a point and I think he's bit boring to listen to.",

Now, in the coming years I would like to see the USA deficit come down.  This seems a threat to me.\n\nIf I were a USA voter that has an above average interest in the stock market I would have some considerations\n\n* Bidenomics has seen constant stock market highs.\n   * I assume Harris will mostly continue Bidenomics.\n* USA inflation is among the lowest in the world, top performing country\n   * Many Americans, I feel, have NO CLUE, about what goes on in the rest of the world.  Inflation, immigration - the same problems everywhere.\n* Rate Cuts.\n   * Trump yelled about delaying rate cuts until after the election.  Clearly Trump sees rate cuts as an economic win for Biden. But what is disgusting: **Trump wanted financial progress to be delayed, because it serves him.  Average Joe be damned.  This is what should disqualify Trump for any worker, employer or investor.**\n   * Trump yelled about wanting influence in the Fed.\n      * Somebody with a track record of bankruptcies,  maybe should not be involved in such delicate matters?\n   * Biden, stays away from Fed. As politicians should.  At least, I do not get the impression he has influenced the Fed.\n* Trump being good for the stock market.  Is that true?  Or a false perception?\n   * Trump  inherited a fairly strong economy from Obama, yet Trump caused a 19 billion farmer bail-out, China Tariffs.  His wall is a perpetual liability proposal, costing billions. While rope, ladder, tunnel, saw and slingshot ALL beat Wall. The Wall Money, should be jobs, drones etc.\n   * Covid caused the market to crash, not the fault of Trump, BUT\n      * The market recovered, as it does\n      * People stayed home. Paid off debt AND started to participate in the stock market, which was a growing trend anyway.  People made loads in the market, especially day traders  that were into Bio.  So,  was it Trump?  Or  bored people sitting at home playing Gamestop and Vaccin-stock games?\n\nLong story short.  If you are in the market, you vote for a slow and steady continuation of the current economy.   You do not vote on a wrecking ball.\n\nSure, I am an uneducated nobody.  My opinion, worthless.  But to MAGA,  these Nobel peace price winners do not matter either.......\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/16-nobel-prize-winning-economists-say-trump-policies-will-fuel-inflation-2024-06-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/16-nobel-prize-winning-economists-say-trump-policies-will-fuel-inflation-2024-06-25/)",

        "post_body": "TLDR: \n\nCormedix (pharma), is going through the commercialization of DefenCath (already FDA approved, and manufactured).\n\nSales have already started with great traction during the first weeks of the current quarter (Q3), but are going to ramp up much faster than expected.\n\nThe company has no debt, enough cash to reach profitability, and one of the highest insider ownerships.\n\n# Product \u2013 medical\n\nCorMedix (https://cormedix.com/investors/) is a pharmaceutical company owning DefenCath (https://www.defencath.com/).\n\nDefenCath is a catheter lock solution that contains taurolidine and heparin. It is designed to reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in adults undergoing hemodialysis, a common procedure for patients with chronic kidney failure. The solution is applied into the central venous catheter after each dialysis session and then withdrawn before the next use.\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2023, DefenCath showed (in the LOCK-IT-100 study) significant clinical benefits, with a 71% reduction in the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) compared to a heparin-only group in clinical trials. The primary ingredients work by preventing bacterial growth within the catheter, and the heparin component helps maintain catheter patency by preventing blood clot formation.\n\nCRBSIs occur when bacteria or other pathogens enter the bloodstream via a catheter, which can be used to administer fluids, medications, hemodialysis. So, catheters can be gateway for infections (even more when they are left in place for long, or if proper hygiene is not maintained.\n\nThe skin around the catheter insertion site naturally harbours bacteria, and despite sterilization procedures, these microbes can migrate along the catheter and enter the bloodstream, causing a systemic infection. These infections are particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients, which is almost always the case, when using a catheter.\n\nWhen a CRBSI is suspected, immediate medical intervention is necessary. Treatment generally involves removing the infected catheter and administering antibiotics to clear the infection. In severe cases, where the infection spreads beyond the catheter site, it can result in complications such as sepsis or endocarditis (infection of the heart\u2019s inner lining). Left untreated, CRBSIs are potentially fatal, especially in high-risk populations like patients on hemodialysis.\n\nCRBSIs are considered partially preventable with proper catheter care and infection control protocols, which involve strict sterile techniques during catheter insertion and maintenance. For example, cleaning the insertion site with antiseptic solutions and covering it with sterile dressings can reduce the risk of infection. Alternative to DefenCath exist, however they are different nature, focusing on treatment rather than prevention. \n\n| Product/Brand       | Company              | Primary Function             | Use Case                               | Key Differences from DefenCath                                                                              |\n|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mino-Lok            | Citius Pharmaceuticals| Antibiotic lock solution      | Treat existing CRBSIs in catheters     | Reactive treatment for existing infections; not used for prevention.                                        |\n| TauroLock           | TauroPharm GmbH       | Catheter lock solution        | Reduce catheter-related infections     | Primarily marketed in Europe; overlap in function but less effective and popular in preventing CRBSIs compared to DefenCath in the U.S. market. |\n| ClearGuard HD Cap   | Pursuit Vascular      | Antimicrobial barrier cap     | Prevent infection at catheter exit site| Only addresses external infection risks; does not treat or prevent internal lumen infections.               |\n| Heparin Lock        | Various               | Anticoagulant solution        | Maintain catheter patency and prevent clotting | Limited antimicrobial properties; mainly prevents clotting without addressing bacterial or fungal infections effectively. |\n| Catheter Patches    | Various               | Skin barrier and catheter securement | Protect insertion site from external contamination | Focus on securing catheter and providing a barrier at the skin level, not inside the catheter.               |\n\n# Product - legal\n\nThe story of Cormedix is long and painful, with unsatisfactory studies leading to two complete response letters, followed by a failure on the side of their 3rd part manufacturer.\n\nNow that all these issues have been resolved, DefenCath benefits from intellectual property protection that extends through 2042. It has secured 10 years of market exclusivity pursuant to FDA approval as a New Chemical Entity (NCE, 5 years) and a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP, 5 years). Also, DefenCath has the potential to receive an additional 6 months of exclusivity upon completion of a pediatric hemodialysis study.\n\nHere below, some not so interesting links to the press releases, for whoever wanted to verify some information. Anyway, the gist of it is that DefenCath has inpatient reinbursment with NTAP and outpatient with TDAPA.\n\nLinks:\n\n- The FDA approval of DefenCath was supported by results from the randomized, double-blind, active control, multicenter pivotal Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DefenCath for reducing the incidence of CRBSIs in patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-fda-approval-of-defencath-to-reduce-the-incidence-of-catheter-related-bloodstream-infections-in-adult-hemodialysis-patients/)\n- On January 25, 2024 the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) notified CorMedix that the agency has determined DefenCath will be eligible for reimbursement in accordance with the ESRD PPS. As such, CorMedix is entitled to submit an application for a Transitional Drug Add-On Payment (TDAPA) which currently allows for five years of additional payment reimbursement to outpatient providers. CorMedix submitted its TDAPA application on January 26th after receiving the CMS notification, and CMS has subsequently confirmed receipt. As a result of CMS\u2019 determination that DefenCath is within the scope of the ESRD PPS and eligible for TDAPA, CorMedix has established its list price (WAC) of $249.99 per 3ml vial, to account for the market dynamics and functionality of the TDAPA framework. Should CMS make a future determination that DefenCath is eligible for Medicare Part B reimbursement, CorMedix has committed to CMS to reduce the list price accordingly: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-and-reimbursement-updates/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-and-reimbursement-updates/)\n- Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that DefenCath\u00ae meets the criteria for a Transitional Drug Add-On Payment (TDAPA) in the anti-infective functional category: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-tdapa-to-defencath/)\n- Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that DefenCath\u00ae qualifies for pass-through status under the hospital Out-Patient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).\u00a0 Pass-through status provides for separate payment under Medicare Part B for the utilization of DefenCath in the out-patient ambulatory setting for a period of at least two years, and up to a maximum of three years: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-pass-through-status-to-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-cms-grants-pass-through-status-to-defencath/)\n\n# Sales growth\n\nThere is not much to say about the current mgmt, but so far, during commercialization, they have been able to meet their predictions. Management has one of the highest insider ownership in the industry, and has been holding shares even during the past difficult years.\n\nI expect sales to ramp up very quickly due the nature of the dialysis market, even faster than predicted by management. The dialysis market is in fact divided in inpatient and outpatient dialysis procedures.\n\nInpatient dialysis refers to dialysis treatments that are provided within a hospital setting. This type of dialysis is often used for patients who require immediate and intensive care: it is particularly important for patients who may have complications or require stabilization before transitioning to outpatient care.\n\nOutpatient dialysis, is provided in specialized dialysis centres or clinics outside of a hospital setting. This type of dialysis is more common for patients with chronic kidney disease who require regular, long-term treatment. Outpatient dialysis allows patients to maintain a more normal lifestyle, as they can schedule their treatments around their daily activities.\n\nThe outpatient market is about 10 times the size of the inpatient one, so, while DefenCath is approved in both (inpatient since April: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-u-s-inpatient-commercial-availability-of-defencath-taurolidine-and-heparin/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-u-s-inpatient-commercial-availability-of-defencath-taurolidine-and-heparin/), outpatient since July: https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-outpatient-availability-of-defencath/), it is the second we mostly care about.\n\nThe outpatient market is interesting because it is dominated by a few large size dialysis providers, with the smaller players owning only a very small fraction of the total market. In particular, there are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them (Fresenius and DaVita) control 70% of the market. This means that there is not going to be the usual overhead in OpEx with respect to sales that we often see during the launch of other drugs: sales will be able to ramp up more quickly and at a lesser cost. On the other hand, the two large providers have more negotiating power, that could lead to lower margins or slower negotiations.\n\nAnyway, the news we had during Q3 paint a very good picture of the outpatient launch.\n\nDuring the last earnings call (https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-second-quarter-and-six-month-2024-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/) nothing interesting about Q2 was communicated, other than reiterating good financial health of the business (no debt, enough cash to reach profitability, decrease in R&D, increase in OpEx). The interesting information was instead about the first weeks of Q3, with quarter-to-date net sales of $5.2 million, as of August 13th.\n\nIt is important to note that initial sales in the outpatient setting have been driven by orders from small and mid-size dialysis operators (like Arc Dialysis: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-arc-dialysis-llc/), announced at the beginning of Q2, where we talk about of 20 dialysis centers), and the company has verified pull-through to the clinic level for more than 95% of these shipments. So, we can expect these sales to stay consistent during the rest of the year, with additions from new patients and large size dialysis operators.\n\nAs predicted in the call, in the following months the contracts with the big guys materialized:\n\n- On May 28th was announced a commercial agreement with a mid-size dialysis provider (250 outpatient dialysis clinics):: [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-top-tier-dialysis-provider/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-commercial-agreement-with-top-tier-dialysis-provider/)\n- On Sept 9th was announced a commercial agreement with a large-size dialysis provider (2000 outpatient dialysis clinics; given the number, it can only be Fresenius/DaVita): [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-new-commercial-agreement/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-new-commercial-agreement/) (up to 4,000 patients nationally)\n- On Sept 19th was announced a commercial agreement with a mid-size dialysis provider (250 outpatient dialysis clinics): [https://cormedix.com/ormedix-inc-announces-new-commercial-agreement/](https://cormedix.com/ormedix-inc-announces-new-commercial-agreement/)\n- On Oct 8th was announced a commercial agreement with a mid-size dialysis provider (200 outpatient dialysis clinics): [https://cormedix.com/cormedix-announces-new-commercial-agreement-with-mid-sized-dialysis-operator/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-announces-new-commercial-agreement-with-mid-sized-dialysis-operator/)\n\nSo, out of the top 5 dialysis operators that control the market, the 3 mid-size are already on board, plus one between Fresenius and DaVita.\n\nIt is worth to mention that however the large-size provider (whichever of the two it is) is not fully on board, but only experimenting with up to 4000 patients. This, however, at $250 per vial, 1 vials per treatment, 3 treatments per week, would still amount to up to $150M per year alone.\n\nManagement during the call was pretty vague (and shy) in giving guidance clearly due to not being sure those contracts would be signed soon enough. I believe sales are going to be high due to all the new available outpatient facilities, and, more importantly, management will be confident enough to give clear (and great) numbers for the guidance of the next quarters.\n\n# Valuation\n\nThe size of the CRBSI market is about $2.5B per year, increasing due to aging population. At the moment the approval of DefenCath does not cover this entire market (but only the hemodialysis segment), however, medically there is not a big difference, and management expects approval for the rest of the market in the coming years. (Here the press release about label expansion: https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-receives-fda-feedback-on-potential-label-expansion/).\n\nAnyway, even only considering hemodialysis, Cormedix projects to sell 4 million vials on the inpatient side and 37 million vials on the out-patient side, at $250 per vial. It is difficult to get to precise numbers at this stage: the problematic factor to estimate is the probability of success of the commercialization, rather than the value of a hypothetical bull case. The outcome is quite binary, with DefenCath either becoming standard of care or just being used in some very niche \u2013 particular cases.\n\nGiven the initial available information, the size of the TAM, and the current market cap of the company, I think this is clearly a very asymmetric bet, with good probability of being a multibagger.\n\n# Upcoming Catalysts\n\nSales, guidance, increase in the number of patients for the current large size provider, contract with the other large size provider.\n\n# Risks: IP protection\n\nSome risks are obvious: poor market penetration, health issues, \u2026 (like any other drug).\n\nThere is however a possible additional issue, that I judge to be very low probability, however it is still worth to mention: the patent defensibility of Taurolidine. As I show in the table of the competitors, there is  a combo called \u201cTaurolock\u201d, which was taurolidine/citrate, which was marketed in Germany a couple years ago with no success.\n\nNow, the flop in the commercialization of Taurolock is not a reason of concern. Due to the nature of public healthcare in Europe, doctors and hospitals have very different incentives when it comes to the choice of treatments, with European doctors being pressured by the hospitals to adopt low cost solutions (and in this case making an effort into doing \u201cbetter hygiene\u201d, rather than purchasing Taurolock, even if it may pose some additional risks).\n\nWhat could be reason of concern are the unsuccessful attempts of Cormedix to protect their patent in the EU. For this reason I would recommend to read the SA article and the comment from  u/jackandjillonthehill I am citing in the references (the comment is not completely correct regarding the patent protection, but gives some context).\n\n# Credit to original authors\n\nI started building up my position in CRMD only after the last earnings, but I actually started keeping an eye on the company after this post on this subreddit of a few months before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1cbjfz2/cormedix\\_crmd\\_a\\_deep\\_value\\_opportunity\\_tldr\\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1cbjfz2/cormedix_crmd_a_deep_value_opportunity_tldr_at/)\n\nI couldn\u2019t find many interesting reads to link as references. I am including the two most interesting ones I could find: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing\\_discussion/comments/1cg8e4f/crmd\\_cormedix\\_due\\_dilligence\\_on\\_an\\_fda\\_approved/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/1cg8e4f/crmd_cormedix_due_dilligence_on_an_fda_approved/) from  u/GermanSEOwriter and https://www.reddit.com/r/Stocks\\_Picks/comments/1cf7r6f/cormedix\\_a\\_longterm\\_value\\_and\\_short\\_term\\_growth/.\n\nThe most interesting reference I would point to is however an old short report on SA (can not post links on reddit, but the title is cormedix-infected-hype-valuation-swollen) indicated by  u/jackandjillonthehill in his comment:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1cbjfz2/comment/l10lue5/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button. The information in the article regarding the business is now completely irrelevant, but what is important is the discussion about IP infringement and commercialization in Europe some years ago.\n\nu/Fretwizard125 also has a lot of interesting comments during discussions in r/CRMD.

Do you think smaller dialysis companies may be using DefenCath more than the what the main 5 operators will do?\n\nGiven the figures presented by management at the Q2 call, they did about $5M sales in the first half of Q3, only with sales to small-size dialysis centers. Assuming no channel stuffing (and I think we can trust the management about this), the company would get $40M per year just with them.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst case, with no more growth in the small-size operators market, as if the company was already selling to all of them, and assume similar rate of utilization for the 3 mid-size operators.\n\nI don't have the numbers exactly, except for Fresenius+DaVita having 70% of the market, but let's model it as:\n\n- 35% Fresenius\n- 35% DaVita\n- 20% mid size operators\n- 10% small size operators\n\nWhich seems to me kind of a fair assumption.\n\nIn this case we could expect $120M in sales/year from mid+small size operators.\n\nThen we have the contract with one of the big guys for up to 4000 patients, which, of course, could also mean 0 patients, but, unless they just spit random numbers, I would expect to be in that ballpark. Let's say 2000 patients. Then this would be $150M/year. In my opinion, the choice of the number 4000 could be the upper bound of that LDO's estimate for the critical patients that satisfy the criteria you mention.\n\nBase case of $270M/year?",

Market expectations are very low, so I think it is easy to see the stock grow.\n\nI think it is during Q4 that we can do more digging about what is gonna happen in 2025. At the moment the growth is cheap (just onboard more dialysis providers), while in the future it is gonna be more expensive (you need dilaysis providers to increase their utilization rate, or, in a more distant future, to achieve label expansion). I think during Q4 we could manage to get a feeling of how tough that is.\n\nSo, my positions are:\n\n- not a lot of shares\n\n- december 2024 calls with strikes between 4 and 8 (but I bought them a long time ago)\n\n- march 2025 calls with strikes between 10 and 15 (that I started buying during our recent run up)\n\nI would hope to see it around 20 by year end, and then I will decide what to do. If I believe it is becoming standard of care I will keep rolling the calls at increasing strikes until 50-100, otherwise I will just hold shares: company has the cleanest balance sheet, and is gonna have good free cash flow (doesn't even seem a pharma company lol) so we can take all the time in the world.",

But it is not that I think that we are going to reach a level of market penetration anywhere close to 50%.\n\nShort term, I see the base case as I said to $250M per year, and bull case as a contract with the last big guy and utilization still at the same rate as the small guys, so about $400M per year.\n\nAt this point they can not just onboard more providers, they need the providers to increase their use of defencath. The interrogative is how good will the dialysis guy be at spotting the right patients to which give DefenCath, right? Because if they were 100% precise, they could just give DefenCath to the right ones. Of course this is not going to happen, but still they will want to draw the line somewhere, and Cormedix will have to offer some discounts in order to push them.\n\nIf I had to get a feeling of which price point is sustainable I would do as follows.\n\nI am pretty sure Cormedix can keep DefenCath more expensive than the option of not using DefenCath and facing CRBSI (as aggregate I mean).\n\nTaking the market of CRBSI, assuming a bit less than half of it belongs to the hemodialysis segment, and the use of DefenCath will cut it down to one 4th of its size, which would mean savings of $750M. Considering that there are reimbursment agreements in place, Cormedix could ask for twice that, so around $1.5B in the medium term.\n\n(Let's say that in the dialysis centers they are quite bad at spotting the risky patients, and make 15M vials per year, that would be about $100 per vial, which sounds reasonable.)\n\nNorth of 3B if they get label expansion, in the long term.",

But those numbers didn\u2019t include both a new mid-size operator (MSO) or the large size operator (LSO) that started with 4000 patients initially. \n\nLooking at the LDO next year and assuming that they ONLY stay at 4,000 patients, then 4,000x3 treatments/week x2 vials/treatment = 24,000 vials/week x 13 weeks per quarter = 312,000 vials used in the quarter. Assume they only sell the vials at $100/vial ($250 less discounts) = $31 Million per quarter. Just taking that for a full year and adding the $45 Million from before and we get over $160 Million. Then add the additional new MSO and we are at well over $200 Million. Personally, your numbers are way off. \n\nNow you say you know and understand biotechs and pharma, then you should know that when there is reimbursement by CMS/Medicare they give a large incentive for outpatient providers to take on new drugs so they can become SOC.

        "post_date": "2024-10-19T10:06:15",
        "post_body": "TLDR: Acquisitions destroy value, however it really depends on the acquisition type done and the location of the company.\n\nI've read a lot about how acquisitions destroy value and recently got access to S&PCapitalIQPro so I wanted to test out if this was true and what types of acquisitions destroyed the most value.\n\nHere are the results for you:\n\nOpen source code I used to generate these results (Too complex a task for excel):  \n[https://github.com/MartinDawson/stock-research-analyzer](https://github.com/MartinDawson/stock-research-analyzer)\n\nWebsite is here: [https://martindawson.github.io/stock-research-analyzer/](https://martindawson.github.io/stock-research-analyzer/)\n\nUS companies that do acquisitions (abnormal returns compared to the SPX index at the same time frame):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t036v8yj7qvd1.png?width=1697&format=png&auto=webp&s=0891bb062d729baa06b6f4c72e5a13a6d2f77e56\n\nSample size of 43k.\n\n* US companies destroyed value overall after they announced the acquisition. Their stock prices dropped by -8.18% by month 20 and then started rebounding but by month 29 they were still down by -5.07%.\n\nPossible causes of the rebound could be that management have impaired and written off goodwill related to the acquisition by this point and realised they have overpaid or most of the acquisition related distractions on business performance has passed at this point.\n\nThis confirms what Aswath Damodaran has been teaching about in his videos & papers about acquisitions.\n\nUK companies that do acquisitions (abnormal returns compared to the FTSE All-Share Index at the same time frame):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw7lalru7qvd1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=9356b2d3bcabb5024b242cee1fe9198737d54fbd\n\n* UK companies actually created value overall. Modest in the first 20 months, beating the FTSE All Share Index by 3% but by month 29 the gain over the index from these companies was 10.2%. If you toggle the 'absolute returns' radio button on the website, you will see the returns of the acquiring companies without being relative to their respective indexes. You can see that the US companies destroy value both relatively and absolutely with acquisitions while UK companies create it. I have no idea why this gap exists between the UK and US acquiring companies but it does.\n\nI have double & triple checked the source data and cleaned the data and it all looks fine, this was a surprising result to me to see UK acquiring companies do so well relative to the FTSE All share index.\n\nNote: The UK has a lower total sample size of 10k\\~ companies, whereas the US has 40k\\~ companies, however 10k should still be more than enough.\n\nUS companies by type of acquisition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4dsfw2558qvd1.png?width=1643&format=png&auto=webp&s=197eb8f07b3adc0d526537061b3f96eb3a9169fd\n\nUK companies by type of acquisition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79zw3fke8qvd1.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea4c309110ebbf9f7ad3bf3128901d391331511\n\nI won't go through all of these, you can see the output chart for yourself, however I will comment on the main patterns.\n\nIn both the US and UK their was a very similar pattern.\n\n* Bankruptcy acquisitions were by far the most profitable, resulting in an average abnormal cumulative return since acquisition of 52.77% over 29 months. This makes sense because when companies go bankrupt they do firesales on their assets which means the acquirers can buy them for cheap, including the entire business. The sample size was only 112 companies though so take this with more of a grain of salt.\n* LBO was the second most profitable acquisition type for both US and UK which was very surprising to see. It seems that loading up on debt and acquiring a company seems to produce good returns above the SPX & ASX indexes. Maybe this is because the acquiring company quickly sells down the debt and steamlines the business after by selling non-core assets? I'm not sure but the sample size of 2669 is large and so this is quite clear\n* Management Participated acquisitions seem to do decent as well, giving 8.22% abnormal returns for US and 32% for UK. This might be explained by management putting their own money in as part of the deal so they are more incentivized or confident that the acquisition is correct. Note the small sample size for US companies of 120 and UK of 149 though.\n* Larger cap acquirers seem to perform significantly better than smaller cap acquirers.\n* Companies that do multiple acquisitions still destroy value, but they destroy much less value than companies that do a single acquisition. You can see companies that did a single acquisition had a -60% return for the US and -15% for the UK. This had a large sample size of 3355 as well.\n\nMaybe single acquirers are less experienced on what to look for or more likely to overpay?\n\n* Cash deals give significantly higher returns than stock deals do. US companies cash deals gave 5.55% whereas the stock deals gave -45.29% since the acquisition announcements. A massive difference. This might be explained by acquiring companies being more likely to issue stock for acquisitions if they think their company is overvalued. An overvalued acquirer is going to drop more than a non-overvalued one in the long term. The sample size for cash deals was 16561 and for stock it was 3859 for the US, both very large sample sizes.\n* Companies that have acquired others from 2016 - Today have performed significantly worse for the US than they did from 2000-2007. Whereas the opposite happened for UK companies. I have no real explanation for why this could be.\n* Smaller acquisitions relative to the acquirers market cap destroyed less value than larger acquisitions. If you see the size of 2-10% they returned -8.5% for US companies whereas 50-100% returned -15%. The sample sizes for these are large as well.\n* Minority acquisitions did not do any better than majority acquisitions which is also surprising. Note the sample size of 3k whereas majority had a 40k sample size.\n* Withdrawn & terminated acquisitions surprisingly destroy an insane amount of value still as well. This might be because of the costs and distraction that happens when pursuing the acquisition.\n* Reverse mergers and backdoor ipos seem to be insanely value destructive for US and UK companies and should never be done in any circumstance.\n\nI've also plotted the worst/best drawdowns and peaks for every type of combination (that had a sample size of > 500). For example for the US companies, you can see the worst combination possible of acquisition type here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asc9ewjt8qvd1.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=a657ec6580b3ab582099e3b8b4f7dfebe8906423\n\nWas this one:\n\n    ```json\n    {\"dateRange\":\"2016-today\",\"sizeByTransactionValue\":\"all\",\"publicOrPrivate\":\"private\",\"acquisitionsNumber\":\"all\",\"acquirerMarketCap\":\"all\",\"status\":\"completed\",\"dealType\":\"stockDeal\",\"acquisitionType\":\"majority\"} (Count: 598)\n    ```\n\nThis combination resulted in a massive destruction of capital, worse than all other combinations basically.\n\nYou can have a look at the other tabs yourself and see which ones are the best and worst performing combinations.\n\nNote: The reason the returns go below -100% is because these are since the acquisition was announced. So if the stock price went up in the months preceding the acquisition announcement then it's possible to get a value > -100%.\n\nIf you want to see which specific combination your companies acquisition will return, you can check out the \\`outputRaw/acquisitions/${region}.json\\` file to see the entire dump of all combinations and find the same combination that matches your company.\n\nNote: If their is a small \\`count\\` number then that's because the sample size is very small for that combination and shouldn't be relied upon.\n\nIn the above charts I threw away combinations that had < 500 sample size so that we could get relevant results.\n\n# Data validation\n\nThe most important thing in analysis is clean data or the results are useless. I've taken great care in cleaning the data and validating it by doing the following:\n\n* Using S&PCapitalIQPro which doesn't have survivorship bias in the results & has high quality data.\n* Ran the \\`cleanData.js\\` functions before processing which does the following for share price & index data:\n\n1. Converts \\`''\\` & \\`0\\` to \\`null\\` values in.\n2. Checks if any percentageChange between 2 numbers is \\`> 1000%\\` & \\`< 100%\\`, if it is it sets the entire row to be null values as this is most likely bad data rather than a real Month-On-Month change of share prices.\n3. Filters out companies that have <$10m in marketCap size (\\`minMarketCapForAnalyzingInM\\` in the args). This is needed to stop nano-caps which have ridicilous % changes sometimes Month-On-Month. These don't really reflect true shareholder value either, just liquidity issues & pumps/dumps a lot of times.\n4. A bunch of tests in \\`acquisitionFilters.test.js\\` & \\`calculate.test.js\\`. You can verify them with \\`npm run test\\`.\n\nI also tested using \\`math.js\\` to remove any chance of \\[\\`numerical instability\\`\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical\\_stability) when calculating cumulative Month-On-Month changes in share prices, however the slowdown in processing speed wasn't worth the tiny bit extra in precision. The small floating point errors don't effect the results either so it was redundant.\n\nFeel free to run the code yourself or double check my calculations as it's all open source here: [https://github.com/MartinDawson/stock-research-analyzer](https://github.com/MartinDawson/stock-research-analyzer)\n\nWebsite is here: [https://martindawson.github.io/stock-research-analyzer/](https://martindawson.github.io/stock-research-analyzer/)\n\nI will be doing more of these analysis on companies, the next one will be on management compensation and how that is tied to shareholder value/destruction.

Not sure though, it could also just be a classic, corelation not equal to causation.\n\nWhat's interesting though is that the type of acquisitions that destroy or create value are ranked in roughly the same way between US and UK. I.e Stock deals are always way worse than cash, reverse mergers are terrible etc etc so I think that's probably the most valuable chart in this post.",

Likewise with ben grahams bookS. DONT START WITH THOSE they will turn u off! Put chapter 8 and 20 of intelligent investor through chatgpt and that will give u succinct info in a few sentences. But as u understand more go to these sources, even buffet\u2019s partnership letters are a great read. \n\nFinancial statements can be understood generally online then start reading a bunch of 10k and 10q of diff companies to get a feel of it.\n\nReal estate im sorry i dont have much understanding of it. \n\nBut reach out to me id love to talk abt this further especially with similar background in eng!

Dollar cost average buying with my monthly salary, after paying my expenses and mortgages first.\n\nMy reasons:  \n1. I think the company with good endogeneous money generation with some shareholder rewarding policy is resilient to boom and bust business cycles. Also, it is easier to anticipate the future trajectory. If the company has too volatile P/E or P/FCF historically, then I give minus points.  \n2. Too small companies have legal risks and various external risks, which I cannot anticipate and cannot employ countermeasures.  \n3. The primary sector companies, especially coal, oil, and natgas mining companies, are very transparent and easy to understand models of business. They usually open up their future guidance and future revenue forecast with real tangible FID (final investment decisions) to the shareholders.

It may work for some companies, which are really stable and high CF generators, but still be careful.\n\n  \nAlso, check management's compensation (in a proxy statement) - are they incentivised to just grow one-year revenues/EBITDA (easily manipulable) or is compensation more focused on FCFs and returns on capital.\n\n  \nI plan to write up a more detailed check-list, which I used to evaluate the company, including the management",

IMO this changes a lot of what the company is worth and their long term value.\n\nI would say this is fine as a more short term play and especially if you know their patent for whatever expires in a year or so. You know you can hold it for that long, but as far as long term investments go it's almost a libality because then you're picking companies based on timeline horizons rather than longterm value and you have to worry about (remembering to) swap companies out as they lose and secure their usually sole revenue streams.\n\nPart of a good value company to me is investing in it on the notion that the company is good enough to buy and hold for a long while without having to worry about it all the time.     \nAlso, personally I think patents and other ways government prohibits competition are BS and not a healthy market function so I'm kind of against companies who utilize this as their business model, but that's just me. \n\nAm I making sense?",

The same issue arose with Fiat Chrysler before it became Stellantis. People have misconceptions about this automaker, thinking it underperformed the market, but, especially if you held since the Global Financial Crisis, you're looking at extraordinary gains, especially when you consider the shares in Ferrari it spun off to shareholders, and the high dividends it pays.

This is not always the case.  Not because of any malfeasance but because of arcane (archaic?) accounting principles.  You can find large, well-known, highly profitable companies that have a book value a little above or a little below zero.  \n\nIntangible assets, including goodwill,  are harder to value than a piece of machinery and more prone to errors.  Some analysts deal with this by calculating a book value, called tangible book value, that excludes the intangible assets entirely.  Total assets - Intangible assets - Total Liabilities.   \n\nI'm not a big fan of this figure because in most cases the intangible assets do have real value, especially in a modern knowledge economy less dependent of physical assets.

        "post_body": "I am curious on what everyone's thoughts on the future of regional banking is? About a year and half ago we had the big SVB implosion which also took done a couple other regional banks. Basically all bank stocks took a pretty big hit during that incident. We also saw a massive outflow of consumer deposits from the regionals that were pushed into the large national banks. Some pretty high profile people were calling this the death of regional banking, Kevin O'Leary was one if I recall. Even the regionals that did survive the chaos were not looking too good afterwards. \n\nI picked up some shares in my favorite bank shortly after the industry meltdown, and this turned out to be an amazing time to get some decent companies for dirt cheap. Anyone else who scooped up some shares in basically any surviving bank is likely up tremendously at this point. S&P regional banking ETF $KRE is up 46% this year, compared to $SPY's 37% for example. \n\nHowever I have concerns about if it's worth holding onto my stock for the long term? Is it possible that we may be reaching the end of line? Does this industry have much of a long-term future? These regionals are still heavily exposed to commercial lending, and can't compete on the same level of convenience and amenities as the large national banks can. Really the only advantage regionals seem to have is that they know the local market better, and therefore might be better equipped to adjust to consumer needs in the area or spot upcoming geographic trends. But even that advantage is losing it's shine as rural populations continue to shrink and more people prefer convenience over niche specialties. Convince me if I should sell, hold or perhaps even buy more? \n\ntl;dr: Is there any future value in regional banks? Should one cash out their regional bank stock in the near future? ",

That means even with (semi) rigorous financial analysis there are more uncertainties, and I think the events last year highlighted this as some of the banks that went under showed virtually no signs of risk beforehand.\n\nThat said, if the largest banks in the country continue to acquire the smaller ones then there are sure to be some big winners in the regional banking sector, just keep in mind there will probably also be some more failures.",

Specifically private stock you purchased as an investment as opposed to stock based compensation of private stock granted to you as RSUs through employment.  I know there are various private market places for accredited investors. Obviously this kind of investment comes a much higher risk proposition due to lower liquidity and opacity of private corporations.  It seems to me not really in the spirit of value investing as it is difficult to value a company that doesn't publicly disclose their financials. I am, however, interested in stock for companies with an extremely strong moat that could at some point IPO, an example would be Valve (owners of steam) or SpaceX. ",

Personal care  (Unilever, Kenvue, Haleon etc)\n\nOfcourse Energy, as even humans need energy (mitochrondial activity / metabolic ) to survive, every system needs energy. Shell, Chevron, Exxon, Philips 66, PetroBras, Enbride, American Energy, Southern Company, Black Hills, Canadian Natural Resources, Repsol, Enagas, Northwest Natural Holding Company, and many more in that space.\n\nI love those 4 sectors a lot, sectors that will never let you regret your decision, as they are always printing money.\n\nAs OP said smokes, Altria, PMI, BAT, JPIM\n\nInsurance, people pay those, whatever they want to or not (Prudential, Unum, Aegon, NN, Mapfre etc)\n\nTelecom, people need a phone / internet to apply for a job or whatever, Verizon / AT&T\n\n-- Actually industries that always put money in the cash register, a.k.a. predictable cashflows, just think and observe in your own world and unlock those patterns.\n\nAnd honestly the best option is a broad index fund, and even I admit it even with a decent 14,7% TTM return on a mixed  75 blue chip dividend stocks portfolio and VWRL /  TDIV. I'm slightly underperforming the SP500, as i'm not tech heavy (my only tech is: TSMC, Broadcom, ASML, Intel) -- But am very happy with my mainly defensive style, dividend cashflow oriented way of investing. I also sell monthly OTM Puts and sometimes covered calls, to get some premuim income, on top of my monthly dividends to invest back in my portfolio.\n\nBut, I do have war stocks (Raytheon, liked them as they produce Tomahawks and drones), was lucky when I bought them during bad news (something with fake parts scandal), now they are 100+ USD.",

Visa has the real stranglehold on debit card business in most places. Mastercard being the other half of the duopoly. Amex has wealthier clients with generally lower delinquency rates. It can charge higher fees for card payments due to their wealthier customers being more likely to spend more per transaction. Their fees create a loyalty effect, similar to Costco. You pay your annual fee and you\u2019re then going to naturally try and put as much of your spend on that card as possible. Then you get superior rewards and customer service for it. Amex has the network and issues the card. They have the data right through the cycle. The best part? Credit cards are the easiest form of a loan to give. The card is right there and people can buy what they want. It\u2019s hard to compete with this combo. Even younger generations are making up a huge portion of their new sign ups. Yes, some European areas may not be that big on it, but that\u2019s fine. Amex is a beast in the nation with one of the most powerful consumers and economies. That\u2019s a good thing. Americans love their credit cards and their spending. \n\nThey likely won\u2019t face the same sort of regulatory scrutiny as the other cards, as those cards are a critical rail for every day people to spend their money electronically. By American Express not being a critical rail for the consumer, it\u2019s less likely to cause an issue. \n\nIt\u2019s a potent business.",

Unless central govt makes an actual meaningful policy change regarding the ability of all house builders to build all types of homes we are going to be stuck in a situation where there\u2019s a crippling need for housing for many years to come. I hope it happens but it\u2019s going to be really tough. We saw what happened in conservative stronghold areas when they tried to make building homes easier. It backfired big time. I have hope that the current Labour administration have the conviction to make home building easier but I do question whether they really understand the scale of the task at hand. \n\nAlso, VTY dont just do affordable housing\u2026 or at least im pretty sure that\u2019s the case?

This is not true at all when you are very cheap all capital returned to shareholders is done at a very efficient rate. Think of it like if you had a company with a  P/E of 1. If you did buybacks every year with 25% of your earnings and dividends with 25% for example your dividend yield would skyrocket assuming no share price growth and every year after that as the P/E drops lower and lower the capital return because increasingly efficient. This essentially forces stock price growth. Moreover Sirius has very low R&D and Cap Ex, i.e. they.don't have to spend a lot to maintain their business therefore they can return capital.at a high rate \n\nAdditionally consolidating industries, like back in the day when he bought newspaper companies it was during the process of consolidation which radio companies seem to be in the process of doing. \n\nTL;DR. So I'd say Value, dependability of cash flows(subscription model), circle of competence, strong balance sheet, low maintenance costs, high potential net payout yield.",

I'm pleased to announce that the screener has undergone a significant upgrade. It is now much faster, leveraging Go and Python. The program now defaults to screening all stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ (\\~5900 tickers, excluded warrants and preferred stocks). Some of the key metrics it retrieves are:\n\n* Last Price\n* Enterprise Value\n* Owner Earnings per share\n* 5y and 10y Growth Numbers (revenue, eps, ebit, ebitda, fcf, dividend, bv, stock price)\n* Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\n* Ten Cap\n\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback from the community. You are welcome to collaborate as well. I will keep improving it.\n\nOn the repo below you can find a recent output Screener.csv you can utilize.\n\nThe program repository is on Github: [https://github.com/vue-dot-com/value\\_investing\\_screener](https://github.com/vue-dot-com/value_investing_screener).\n\n",

While the net income for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024, showed significant growth of 142.5%, the quarterly data for Q2 2024 revealed a decline of 6.89% compared to the previous quarter. This inconsistency in net income growth poses a challenge to sustained profitability.\n\nSimilarly, the free cash flow for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024, experienced a substantial decline of 70.17%. The quarterly data for Q2 2024 also showed a decrease of 53.9% in free cash flow. This decline in free cash flow can impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives and maintain dividend payments.\n\nAnalyst estimates for CVS's EPS indicate a cautious outlook for the near future. The mean EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, is $6.54, with a slight increase to $7.34 for 2025. While these estimates suggest some growth, the company needs to address its current challenges to meet these expectations and ensure dividend sustainability. \n\n# CVS Health Reportedly Considers Sale of Its Insurance Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considering the sale of its insurance business. The possibility of splitting the pharmacy chain from the insurance business, called Aetna, is under consideration by the company's board. The sale plan comes after the firm came under pressure from investors for a structural realignment.\n\nAny stock purchase now and your losing the value of the insurance segment which was a significant portion.\n\nAetna, as part of the healthcare benefits segment, contributes significantly to CVS's gross income, accounting for about 31.08% of the total revenue.",

Money manager or Businessman.\n   - Both. Buffett accumulates the cash from the businesses owned by Berkshire and allocates it into either the other more promising businesses they own or new investments. To understand which businesses are better to inject capital into though, you need to be somewhat of a businessman as well. But if you\u2019re wondering if he \u201cruns\u201d a company like a regular CEO, not really. \n\nQ3. Ackman\u2019s outperformance.\n   - Opposite to Q1.

While sg&a cost climbed up their \"new\" exuberance faded and now they will die (market cap of 500m, debt of 1bn). Beyond meat is toast.\n\nThe technology of \"synthesizing\" something. I've studied this for the last 2 years, spoke with the top guys at Glanbia, Sadafco, Alfa Laval, (those 3 are doing the same as the 3 french !) project in the middle east to cut dependencies on Yili (the queen of all dairy stocks).\n\nAs Yili took over the thrown of New Zealand (Fonterra/synlait) as New Zealand was the 1 top milk exporter in the world. \n\nYili bought out New Zealand because of all these c02 emissions. New Zealand killed their main export product and didn't have the technology to syntheticcally make it.\n\nSadafco/Glanbia/Alfa Laval do, and they are building a factory in Algeria as we speak as it's the most milk importing country. \n\nMichelin/bank/Danone think more local European competitions. So it's not \"creating new\" it's literally FTE salary to polish a diamond strategy to higher levels to compete with the Yili and Pirelli of this world. Pirelli delivers tires by Petrochem so Michelin knows exactly what margin requirement enhancement they need for out pricing Pirelli. \n\nThat will happen. Because albeit the amount sounds low, you need to think of equations basically. The bank then comes in as collateral to *sponsor* once completed. \n\nBecause you can syntheticcally create fake rubber. It's enhancing of that formula. But also for syntethic dairy, synthetic milk, cheese, and Nestle is eagerly waiting to jump in (European band wagon) as this technique is nestled in Europe starting at a company called Methrom Ag\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrohm\n\nThese guys did what Beyond Meat did 20-30 years ago. I happen to know ex co workers of Methrom and blistering barnicles they are clever. They only cared about their production but when I heard them laugh how they finally \"convert funghi into fake burgers while we had that technique 20 years ago\" my ears went wait wait wait, now I get it. Because the European market is trying to reduce reliability on China. And not as country alone, no also Chinese stocks. \n\nPirelli might be Italian, it's chairman is CEO is Chinese of an oil company.\n\nThe main shareholders are Chinese state owned funds. Pirelli is \"Chirelli\". And the Chinese do these reverse mergers often but also - once there isn't any profit to be found, they will dump Pirelli at the get go. \n\nSo very short on New Zealand\nDairy Yili will decline as take a look at the DEBT Yili carries. European dairy makers now this and once Yili margin diminishes they will find themselves in the same problem as Beyond Meat.",

Few competitors in an industry is also likely a sign of a competitive edge that will prevent new entries into the industry. \n\nQualitative ways to see the effects of competitive advantage are a high return on capital employed or invested capital. Another would be the cash flow generated from fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment). Think of it this way. Apple has about $110B in PPE and produces about a $100B in free cash flow annually. You could theoretically build Apple for $100B and generate nearly 100% returns if you could simply copy Apple's business. So, why can't cash flow heavy businesses simply copy Apple's business? Because they can't. Apple has a massive competitive advantage. Growing market share is a good sign of a companies competitive advantage.",

It\u2019s a practice that gets one to understand why consumers would switch from a company or not. I\u2019s argue there\u2019s no right way to go about it, but the more you do it, the better you get at it.\n\nAs per types of moats, there are so many different types of moats, which you can learn here: https://cxl.com/blog/economic-moats/amp/\n\nAs a brief explanation, moats can happen because of: \n1. The **investment the consumer has in a company** (take Google Workspace for example: hard to move to [Microsoft](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/MSFT) if all your emails and files are within the [Google](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/GOOGL) environment), \n\n2.**Scale and low cost** due to large operations: think energy companies, internet providers, airlines, and even retailers like [Amazon](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/AMZN) and [Costco](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/COST). Companies where so much money and even complying with so much regulation is needed,\n\n3. **Network Effect:**similar to #1, but consumers are using a company because other people are. Think marketplaces such as Airbnb, social medias such as [Meta](https://www.capitalclimb.app/company/META)\n\n4. **Branding:**especially durable in consumer companies. Coke, Costco, LMVH, etc.\n\n\nThere\u2019s more.\n\nFor tech companies specifically, on the B2C side, it\u2019s about how hard a company can make for its users to switch from their product and branding.\n\nB2B is the same, plus adding scale (think data centers, for example) and branding.",

I took a look in January but passed on valuation (was at 30x earnings) but now I\u2019m kicking myself!\n  \nThe doggone earnings keep growing! Last quarter operating income was up over 60% year over the year in dollar terms, and 80% year over year in yen terms. It hasn\u2019t grown less than 50% year over in yen terms in any year since the end of COVID. \n  \nSanrio\u2019s business model is pretty unique and interesting. They make a \u201ccharacter\u201d like Hello Kitty and then license them out for clothes, cards, stuffed animals, etc. They also license out the tv show production but have some say in the creative development to make sure the characters stay true to brand. The Hello Kitty character currently accounts for about a third of gross profits but historically has been as much as 70% of gross profits. \n  \nThe incremental margin with this business model is huge. As the popularity of the characters expand, the margin expands - little incremental costs for each additional licensed good, and the extra licensing revenue drops to the bottom line. \n  \nNot cheap at 42x earnings, but seems like a candidate for \u201cwonderful business\u201d that could be bought even at an elevated multiple. I\u2019d probably still wait for something a little lower on the multiple, but with its current growth rates maybe this kind of multiple is reasonable. \n\nCurious for others thoughts and any anecdotes on the popularity of hello kitty or other Sanrio characters!",

Hello Kitty's been around forever and still going strong, but they've got a whole stable of characters to milk. \n\n42x earnings is steep, but if they keep growing at 50%+ it might not be crazy. The key is whether they can keep pumping out popular characters and expanding globally. \n\nI've seen Hello Kitty stuff everywhere from Asia to the US, so they've got solid brand recognition. My kid's obsessed with Gudetama (the lazy egg character), so they're definitely still relevant with the younger crowd.\n\nMight be worth keeping an eye on for a pullback, but missing out on 100% gains stings.

He has a social media presence as \u201cthe red pant man\u201d. There is currently a lawsuit from shareholders to audit the assets, get him to sell the planes, and hopefully institute a dividend. \n \nHowever they are darned good bankers. They kept leverage low during the long period of low interest rates, then ratcheted up lending and purchases of loan pools and bonds during 2022-2023 when rates were high. They then have sold off some of these loan assets and bonds as interest rates declined in 2024. \n  \nThe efficiency ratio is great, now under 40% which is insane for a small bank. They have a really interesting self directed IRA business which allows IRA holders to invest in real estate through their IRA and lets the bank attract a lot of non interest bearing deposits.  \n  \nBook value is now $20.74, putting P/Book under 0.5, and the company earned $1.28 per share THIS QUARTER. If they annualize anything like this the stock is still under 2X PE ratio. \n  \nI know I\u2019m probably gonna regret trusting the red pant man and the Twitter bank crew hates SLRK, but I have to hold my nose and hold this one. My thinking is the lawsuit is dragging everything out in the open and eventually the bank will have to start allocating the excess cash in a more shareholder friendly manner, or management will do a buyout and take the bank private.

I use that as a proxy since I'm not going to have time to research the management team qualitatively. \n\nIn summary, I along with other main metrics (bvps, eps, revenu, fcf) I also give good amount of importance in roic. My rule of thumb is checking if the roic is consistently over 10% over years, then I consider it as good roic, if it's even higher than 10% and consistent it's even.\n\nHope this helps!",

While you are looking at MGPI which makes whiskey barrels, I had a small tracker position in Jack Daniel\u2019s maker BF.B, and I sold it off recently after holding it for 9 months. \n\nI sold it because sales volume wasn\u2019t increasing at all. Management discussed that the possible reasons could be (a) weed (b) gen z (c) ozempic but ultimately they decided that the reason for the lower volume sales was because of elevated inventory at the retailers that needs to be drawn down. (Similar to the reasons given by MGPI)\n\nHowever I am not convinced this is a Company-specific issue as Diageo is also having the similar problems, their higher end tequila is slower to take up, their international efforts are being hampered by issues.\n\nWhile I do think people will comeback to whiskey and while BF has had long periods of no growth (prohibition), I think it will take a while to sort it self out.",

The acquisitions occurred when commodity prices were high (cause that\u2019s when these family businesses usually sell). The debt load is going to come down hugely over the next year or so since SAF production will be fully running and capex will fall off a cliff. Over the past year or so the commodities that darling sells have been depressed as well which is represented in the movement in the stock over the past year+.\n\nBuying darling is essentially capturing spread like revenue on the following long-term themes: \n\nworldwide protein consumption increasing (darling processes like 1/7 animals in the world post slaughter), \n\nconsumer health products (Collagen + Collagen based glp-1 suppressants)\n\nSustainability - huge into SAF production and renewable diesel\n\nLastly animal fat rendering capacity in the world is simply not being created at the same rate as protein consumption is increasing.

Like the polar opposite of wallstreetbets (also funny for its own reasons). \nI've just been getting into investing and trying to look for value investments.\n\nI came across AREC, they have good patents on reusing precious metals used for batteries, magnets etc. Turning used lithium back to 99,8% capacity for example. Very useful in today's society and considering the push to go green and America's push for local winning of these precious resources, it's an interesting stock. \n\nIt went up about 70% last month, sadly I got in a bit late and it's been dropping a little this week. But I do believe it could be a great stock with a healthy long term growth. They've been expanding every year with new plants and recently they've started working together with other companies in the field (Iris metals, and Vulcan elements). And with the increase of electric vehicles, need for magnets etc, there could be a lot of increased need for their product. \n\nHow do others see this stock? \nWhat other things could you look at when assessing a stock like this for its potential?

Its no question that network TV is dying, the question is just how fast.  Then, to offset this, how fast can they grow different revenue stream like direct to customer such as Max.  FCF-wise the company looks undervalued but this FCF is likely in decline due to the above mentioned revenue decline from linear.  Its good that they payed off a massive amount of debt the past 2 years, but the debt levels are still really high and again, will they be able to keep up the same pace of debt repayment if their cash flows decline?  Probably not.  And if they're hyper focused on paying down the debt, that leaves less money to direct towards investments to grow.\n\n  \nAnyways, that being said, I recently started building a position \\~$8 but its a small position and I consider it a speculative play for the turnaround story.  I think MAX has plenty of room to grow internationally and seeing that Disney+ also finally reported a profitable quarter for streaming gives some hope in the streaming business for other companies not named Netflix.  Its one of my gamble picks for now and I'll be picking up some more shares if it drops a bit more in the $7 range.",

YouTube tops the rankings for minutes of content watched by consumers daily in a lot of markets, it has subscribers and ad revenue that is almost the same size as Netflix, but is stuck inside a 23x PE company while the market values Netflix at 38x. Waymo is running tens of thousands of driverless taxi rides per month, while Elon Musk is trying to hype the idea of driverless taxis inside his 56x PE company. I\u2019m not sure either Netflix or Tesla are worth those valuations\u2026!

        "post_body": "I see a lot of people talk about free cashflow as if it's more important than earnings. I don't really understand why. \n\nThe main difference is how capex is treated. Net income smooths capex over time by depreciation and amortisation. Free cashflow would instead recognise the entirety of this capex in the current period.\n\nIf your company needs to buy a machine which costs $10m, and must be replaced every 5 years, the effect on free cashflow would be -10, 0, 0, 0, 0. Whereas net income would be -2, -2, -2, -2, -2. \n\nI can't see any sense in looking at the cashflow in the years when the capex is not occurring and drawing any long term conclusions from it. Yes, there is money available for shareholders now. But in year 6 there won't be, and you'll probably be taking on debt or getting diluted if they have been distributing prior.\n\nAnd I've seen people say, \"ah, well if the company/industry is capex intensive I'll adjust for it\". But earnings have already done that for you lol. Adjusting out, adjusting in... talk about making work for yourself.\n\nAnd another one - \"D&A don't recognise the true costs accurately, because book values are not the same as market value\" - okay this one has some validity. It is true that the value of the machine on the books does not necessarily reflect its market value, or replacement cost. The methods by which D&A recognises costs (usually straight line), are very simplistic. But it is better than lumpsumming the costs into the current period, i.e. it is better than a cashflow perspective.",

You tend to see that FCF-to-NOA is inversely correlated to accruals-to-NOA, because either a company is keeping its cash, or it's reinvesting its cash. Reinvesting its cash leads to lower FCF, even though it's often better for the investor. NOPAT tells you how much the operations are bringing in, regardless of whether the cash is being invested. FCF is informative, but if I had to choose, NOPAT and RNOA are better indicators than FCF and FCF-to-NOA.\n\nThat said, high accruals can be a sign of poor earnings quality.

Moreover, if FCFF is - 20, it's gg cause now u need to know exactly what the firm is spending on if not ur just burning money on a stock pick.\n\nI know what u mean, net income smoothes out the inconsistency and fcf takes into account of inconsistencies such as one time capex, whereby NI to a certain extent represents the normalised version of the business. However, what's great about fcf is that is that u can see \"exactly\" what the business is doing and earning, whereas NI could hide cash expenses behind accounting methods.\n\nTake ur example, if - 2 - 2 - 2 -2 -2 on an income statement. What do we know as investor? The company spends -2 in accounting earnings on D&A but that's not very accurate right. We are not spending -2 every year. We spent - 10 in first year and 0 in second year. You could smooth - 10 out 5 years but what ur doing is essentially making up expenses for the next few years. \n\nIf I bought 10 dollars worth of eggs today, how much did I spend? I spent 10 dollars for 20 eggs, that's what happened right, you can't hide and make stuff up, 10 dollars left my wallet. I did not use the accounting method and say actually \"you know what bro, I actually did not spend 10 dollars, I actually spent 50 cents because I used 1 egg today\". As I highlighted previously, u can smooth it out but what ur doing is assuming and forecasting expenses that are not real ur basically hiding ur expenses to a certain extent and slapping it onto the income statements.\n\nGoing back to ur question, you can technically see how this would lead to how much actual cash ur earning because net income hides ur real earnings, fcf does not hide how much u make. As a result, you can better value the company. I could go further on valuation but maybe later if you want an explanation on fcff and net income deviations.\nBut ur kinda right to a certain extent depending on the situation of the company whether it's growing or declining and selling its assets. But idt u know why ur right imho cause if you knew why ur right, u would not be asking this question. U would know the difference between accounting and cash income and how both would impact valuation depending on the company's growth stage and the it's impact on capital.",

Ultimately cashflow is more important than net income because it is cold hard cash and it's what the business is trying to generate (not a theoretical or estimated amount), other accounts won't necessarily reflect their market values in cash accurately like you mentioned but accountants try their best. There are situations where either can be misleading so you should always consider both. \n\nTake a super capital intense business like Enbridge, I don't own any stock but it's a decent example. Their payout is continually over 100% based on net income but they aim to return 70% of distributable cashflows. \n\nAnother example is companies that have to report MTM hedging, like with annuities and some insurance. Jackson Financial is a good example, it has had very good quarters from a cashflow and operational perspective but in the past has reported wild results from a GAAP perspective.",

Owners earnings is still the best measure. But backing out capex as a whole annually is ridiculous and unrealistic. Annual averages/medians, or even using depreciation should be close enough for a business like that with consistent outflows in those areas.

Ignoring how a business meets its capex, or how capital intensive the business is, by simply not looking down the cash flow statement is not only lazy, but completely ignores the nuances of how capital is allocated and how resources for capital are utilized.

Say a company contract for 10 year\u2019s of work, in which the company receives $100 of cash upfront, and then the revenue is recognized pro rata over 10 years.\n\nIn this simple example on the balance sheet initially the company would debit cash by $100 and credit deferred revenue by $100. In year one on the income statement there would be $100 of revenue / earnings assuming no costs / taxes. On the balance sheet your equity goes up by $10 which is balanced by deferred revenue declining by $10. On the cash flow statement there is no change in cash since all the cash was received upfront.\n\nSo in year one after the upfront consideration, and each subsequent year, you will have $10 of earnings, zero of cash flow, and no changes to the asset side of your balance sheet but equity will increase as revenue is recognized and the deferred revenue liability item on the balance sheet declines.\n\nThe earnings here are just earnings - that is what they are. They are not cash flow. Even if the earnings weren\u2019t non-cash - they are still earnings, not cash. They are just different concepts.\n\nIf you want to learn more I would try to keep an open mind and not be so confident that you are correct especially if your view is not based on a lot of experience.",

        "post_body": "73 million $ market cap in a growing market. They train law enforcement agencies around the US and internationally using virtual reality. Particularly focused on de-escalation and decision making in stressful situations. 95% retention rate and good reviews plus a subscription service to their proprietary software with no meaningful competitors means that if this tech is widely adopted this company would have a moat.\n\nAt this price, the valuation looks great. The stock is beat up because they had a bad Q1 & Q2 which the CEO blames on international orders and pipelines being very slow. Added to this that federal funding is slow to release. But there is interest and these deals should be finalized this year or early next year. \n\nPlus they are launching a new VR headset which has gathered a lot of interest in the community. They will begin shipping towards the end of Q3 which should serve as a catalyst for future growth.   \n  \nFeedback appreciated. Valuations and more points included in the blog post. Thank you!\n\nDetailed post: [https://prateekmalhotra.substack.com/p/vtsi-virtra-inc](https://prateekmalhotra.substack.com/p/vtsi-virtra-inc)\n\n",

VR training is an optional type of training that best case scenario, will be used a handful of times over the course of a year. \n\nAxon has a monopoly in policing and offer their own VR training which is a much easier sell as part of their subscription packages (taser, cloud, justice, cameras). Unfortunately there really isn\u2019t a market for this stuff, or they likely would have been acquired by Axon already.\n\nIf you like this space wait for Axon to pull back. It was a great buy a few months ago but it\u2019s exploded since last earnings.",

It was interesting watching it rocket 18% in one day during the China stimulus drama and then crater since then.    Haven't decided to dip in yet.  The risks of companies associated with China are talked about ad nauseum but it seems that headwinds related to the solar industry are somewhat behind them at this point? Or am I way off base?  I suppose another big catalyst is the upcoming US election of course.\n  \nI mean, CSIQ shareholder equity is more than double it's market cap right now...  \n  \nSo...value or value trap?

        "post_body": "Bursa Malaysia FACB Industries started off as a mattress company. In the early 90s it ventured into China as well the into the stainless steel pipes and fittings sector. Thereafter there was a change in the controlling shareholder. But there was no new business ventures and the group continue with the bedding and steel operations for many years\n\n\n\nAbout a decade ago, the group started to divest its steel business so that today it is left with the bedding operations, its investment in China and lots of cash. \n\n\n\nIn Dec last year, the controlling shareholder pass away and his son has taken over the management of the group. Nothing new has happened so far but I hope that with a new person at the helm, there may be a change in the business fortune. So keep [FACBInd](https://www.i4value.asia/2024/10/is-facbi-value-trap.html#more) in your radar.\n\n",

        "post_body": "[https://www.thetigersprey.com/p/lz](https://www.thetigersprey.com/p/lz)\n\nLegalZoom is yet another interesting story. After all, how is a \\~1.2bn company connected with O.J. Simpson, Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba, and Kobe Bryant, all in completely unrelated ways?\n\nAs someone with a legal background, it\u2019s impossible not to recognize Robert Shapiro as one of LegalZoom's founders. Shapiro was part of O.J. Simpson's \"Dream Team\" of attorneys, who famously led to his acquittal in what is often called the \"trial of the century.\"\n\nBrian Lee, another co-founder, partnered with Kim Kardashian and Shapiro to launch\u00a0ShoeDazzle\\[.\\]com, and later teamed up with Jessica Alba to create The Honest Company. Finally, Jeff\u00a0Stibel, LegalZoom's newly appointed CEO, co-founded Bryant\u00a0Stibel\u00a0with NBA Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant.\n\nEnough with celebs. Let\u2019s focus on the stock!\n\nWithin months of the initial Covid-induced lockdowns in 2020, new business applications, a key indicator of future business formations, rose and have since remained above pre-pandemic levels. As business formations serve as a gateway for customers to access LZ\u2019s broader ecosystem, the question is whether there will be a regressions towards pre-pandemic levels, and to what extent.\n\nWhile the relationship with job quit rates have proven to be spurious, other factors have contributed to this growth, including trends in remote and hybrid work, the proliferation of alternative income streams (e.g., NIL, influencers, and freelancing), the improvement of digital enablement tools (e.g., gig platforms), and the availability of SMB loans and grants. Weighing these factors, I predict a limited regression, after which business applications will resume growing at MSD-to-HSD rates.\n\nAdditionally, Jeff\u00a0Stibel, the newly appointed CEO, argues that LZ \u201cshould be tethered to the recurring services needed by millions of small businesses, well beyond the formation and regardless of where \\[they\\] sit in the macroeconomic cycle.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the new freemium model \u201ccontinues to resonate in the market,\u201d the adoption of higher-value, post-formation products, primarily subscriptions, is expected to accelerate, lifting ARPU closer to its potential.\n\nAt the same time, the ongoing shift in the revenue mix toward subscriptions is expected to structurally drive margins higher over time. For context, subscription revenue gross margins are assumed to align with software peers in the 70%-80% range, while partner revenue, now included within transaction and subscription revenue, is recognized at gross margins close to 100%.\n\nIn light of these points, LZ is unjustifiably trading at a significant discount to SMB SaaS peers. Among these competitors, INTU stands out as particularly relevant, as its QuickBooks solution directly competes with LZ Books, while its TurboTax product previously competed with the recently reoriented LZ Tax.\n\nOn top of trading at an all-time low from a time-series perspective, the current 7.9x discount to INTU seems highly compelling in light of the fundamental acceleration LZ is about to experience. Instead, a 5x to 6x discount, corresponding to a multiple more representative of the broader market, would be more appropriate.",

Average is very sensitive to outliers.\n\nI would suggest you also use a perpetuity terminal value just for sanity check, it is very easily to inflate the terminal value when using multiples, especially during periods of high valuation. For example, Coca-Cola trades at x26 earnings but it is growing at 1-3% annually so slapping an 26x multiple will get you a far higher terminal value compared with a perpetuity terminal value.",

I\u2019m considering reallocating some positions, specifically exchanging ADBE and MSFT for META and ORCL. Both have been trading near recent highs, so I\u2019m cautious about the entry point.\n\nMy rationale:\n\nMETA: Despite the highs, I see long-term potential in their AI and Orion glasses, which could drive further growth. However, I\u2019m hesitant to enter at these levels without more insight into a potential pullback.\n\nORCL: Similarly, with their cloud computing and AI focus. However, it too has been trending upwards, and I\u2019m weighing whether I should wait for a better price point or go in now.\n\nI\u2019m also keeping an eye on SMCI given its strong fundamentals and recent momentum, as well as other opportunities like ASML and CRWD, which have seen recent pullbacks.\n\nWhat do you think about?\n\n",

You wanted a big database in the 90s, you paid the big bucks for Oracle DB. They could do all sorts of things that cheaper databases like SQL Server couldn't. Over time, SQL Server, Postgres and other databases caught up. And I don't know of any companies who are rolling out \\*new\\* Oracle DB. I've worked on systems where a company had an old Oracle DB, but anything new was going onto SQL Server. Anyone wanting to build a new system will choose SQL Server, Postgres or one of the NoSQL databases. The cost savings are massive.\n\nAnd most places I know that are going cloud are going for Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. These are well-established, do the job.\n\nSo what exactly is Oracle's cloud revenue? Forget that they mention AI. Yes, some of it will be AI. But how much is AI? How much is companies thinking \"yeah, we'll put all our growing business on Oracle\" and how much is it just companies that run a load of old Oracle and migrating it from servers in their basement to Oracle's cloud?\n\nI have to add, I'd also like to know these answers for all the clouds.\n\nIt's an important question, because if it's mostly migration, then the growth is not going to keep going. It's going to be a big shift for a short time and then go back to small growth after everyone has migrated.\n\nI wouldn't touch Oracle without getting those answers.",

Buy more AMZN, buy a big position in GOOGL (do it before earnings on Oct 29th). \n\nRationale:\n\nAMZN/GOOGL are way better cloud plays than ORCL. Also the valuation for GOOGL screams nobrainer at 19 forward PE, no debt, huge cash cow, buybacks. Risks for Search business are way overstated, regulatory things will take years and probably blow over with a big fine eventually. Can't imagine choosing META over GOOGL at current valuations. \n\nASML is 50% more expensive than GOOGL, even though ASML had huge guidance cut and GOOGL is firing from all engines (look at Q2 report, it was very good). Overspending on AI infrastructure will ease next year and datacenters aren't a sunk cost because they are a cloud play either way. Demand will catch up with supply at some point. Its tech.

        "post_body": "After the massive leak that lead to a literal mass selloff with the stock, and it being down 5% even today, the question is what price would you buy ASML? Originally my price target to start a position was in the 680's but with this new's I do believe fundamentally things have changed. I think leadership dropped the ball bad and regulations are starting to strangle a lot of profit opportunities. However, ASML still has one of the strongest Moats I've ever seen, and are on the cutting edge of technology. Their Lithography Machines are integral in the production of semiconductor chips that are fueling the AI boom, the shovels so to speak.  Anyways what's everyones price target where it's too cheap to ignore, even with seemingly slowing growth?",

Their technological leadership has carried moores law for a long time now. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember the biggest reason for their guidance miss is the US blocking their sales of DUV machines to Chinese fabs. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with their EUV segment which will continue to grow as Nvidia and TSMC are heavily dependent on those machines to produce cutting edge chips. \n\nHowever, their DUV machines are still a big part of their top line and this will be a headwind for ASML for the medium term. \n\nI\u2019m curious to see if they will capitalize on their pricing power with TSMC and if TSMC passes through those costs to Nvidia. Nvidia\u2019s margins are way too high for their suppliers to not use to their advantage.",

They are very rare, and work fundamentally different compared to other high volume companies.\n\n\nThis lack of orders was very much to be expected. Intel and samsung are a bit in trouble and need restructuring, TSMC us a dominant force and is mildly expanding, China is now banned for most of their product line.\n\n\nBut even with all those bad markers, the net income was good. The outlooks are good. Yes there are some (minor) risks, like low competition on the semiconductor market and bad AI expectation, but these risks do not offset the fact that there is no real alternative for 70% of their products.\n\n\nSo yeah. ASML is fine. Inconsider 630 am absolute steal.",

At 400 million shares outstanding (actually 403 from the year end), that would give you around 160B market cap at that point. 2022 net income was around 5.625B. 160/5.625 = 28.44 PE. So no, 2022 lows for ASML were at best a 28 PE and that was for literally 1 day. And that was a sector wide crash where the aforementioned meta, Google etc. were dirt cheap.\n\nSo as the guy before commented, such a valuation would have to come after a huge sector wide crash on a level that would be significantly greater than 2022 which already sent all of big tech into hell.

        "post_body": "I'd love to hear your thoughts. Here is my analysis of why Nucor, America's largest steel manufacturer is a buy at these prices.\n\nThe steel industry as a whole in the USA makes up a tiny percentage of all steel manufacturing in the world, and steel stocks in general trade at a significant discount to the market as a whole. But I believe out of the major American steel companies, Nucor is the best poised to be a good investment.\n\nFor starters, they have had positive free cash flow for 10/10 of the past years, totaling roughly $38 billion in total FCF brought in. This is larger than their current market cap. On top of that, they only have about $7 billion of *total* debt, while having $5.4 billion of cash and equivalents. They could easily have paid off their total debt just from 2023's FCF, or from their cash balance + 2 of their *worst* years of free cash flows.\n\nAlso, compare Nucor's ROIC metrics to a competitor such as say, U.S. Steel. The [former](https://quickfs.net/company/NUE:US) has maintained a positive and mostly strong ROIC since 2000, with just a small dip into negative territory in 2009. [U.S. Steel](https://quickfs.net/company/X:US), on the other hand, has fluctuated consistently between positive and negative ROIC, while also having negative FCF in 5 of their last 10 years. It is clear which company has been a more consistent earner.\n\nA similar comparison can be made with Cleveland Cliffs and Metallus, although Steel Dynamics has a similarly consistent record as a company (but nowhere near the same size/scope of reach).\n\nAs a cherry on top, Nucor is a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend for the past 50+ years. They also have and continue to plan to buy back shares, which will increase the return for shareholders. Shares outstanding have dropped from 314 million in 2009 to 240 million in 2024, approximately a 24% decrease.\n\nIn conclusion, despite steel being a historically cyclical business dependent on steel prices, I believe Nucor has proven itself to be a strong and resilient player in the US market. As long as they consistently return capital to shareholders, they are a strong buy at today's market cap of $36.5 billion.\n\nLet me know if and why you agree or disagree in the comments!",

                "comment_body": "There\u2019s some really important stuff missing from your consideration of the steel business and an important reason Nucor has been consistently profitable. \n  \nNucor arose as a disruptor because they had electric arc furnaces. EAFs melt scrap steel and turn it into good steel by electrocuting the shit out of it. \n  \nThis is very different than traditional steel which is done by burning the shit out of some iron ore with metallurgical coal. This requires larger capex per plant, but can get to very low cost when scale is large. \n  \nThe margin profiles of the two businesses are totally different. EAF steel plants depend on the spread between scrap and hot rolled steel. Blast furnace depends on the spread between iron ore + coal and hot rolled steel. \n  \nThere are different types of steels and specialty steels, some of which are only doable with blast furnace type plants.  \n  \nNucor and Steel dynamics are both EAF, which is why their profile is similar. Cleveland cliff and Us steel are traditional blast furnace but CLF has some EAF too. US Steel needs to invest more to modernize plants and build some EAF capacity but they don\u2019t have the money. This is why Nippon was coming in to make a bid, but it\u2019s been contentious because CLF and US Steel are in very politically important areas.  \n  \nI favor Steel Dynamics because their plants are newer and the founder is still the CEO and I generally favor founder CEOs when I can get them. \n  \nYou also need to understand the geopolitics of steel which is quite complex. Chinese steel companies overbuilt capacity and were running negative profit margins. This started to change in the mid 2010s when the government forced consolidation of the industry and prices started to turn around for steel. Then the U.S. adopted tariffs on steel which helped US steelmakers. Now the infrastructure bill and IRA include subsidies for U.S. made steel so I think the industry is well protected for US steel makers and margins going forward should be better than historical.",

                "comment_body": "I\u2019ve been working on Nucor too, as you can tell from my post history \n\nMy thesis is that Nucor is an excellent company with a good capital allocation record that has seen a temporary setback in a drop in steel prices, and thus sales, but one that will inevitably revert due to the cyclical nature of the industry.\n\nNucor\u2019s valuation is pretty attractive and their free cash flow is good as well. They have a policy to pay out 40% of net earnings, either in dividends or buybacks. I figured this was very attractive, until I realised free cash is free cash. If they make a good return and somehow use it in the business, to pay off debt, to make buybacks or to pay out dividends, it doesn\u2019t matter - as long as they make the return.\n\nNucor is the dominant US firm with only Steel Dynamics in a near comparison, but they are a smaller company too, which could be a reason for their greater efficiency. \n\nHeres some other stuff though:\nFirst, I struggle to call Nucor a low cost producer. They are the low cost producer among US firms, but the nature of steel is that it\u2019s a commodity and the import/export market is very active. Chinese steel could be imported at cheaper overall prices into the US in some cases, and customers have no incentive to stick with Nucor, despite maybe maintaining a relationship with them - not a strong barrier. In fact, Cleveland Cliffs recently said that Chinese steel is being imported through Mexico to avoid tariffs. There are measures in place to protect domestic steel companies, but if things like this happen\u2026 \n\nSecond, steel prices may have greater to drop. I think the concept of mean reversion is probably what underlies cyclically in the first place. The only companies that can beat mean reversion are the ones that have a moat - they can earn high returns on capital consistently without external factors pulling them down. Nucor, clearly, does not have that sort of dynamic. They may have a claim in being the lowest cost producer, which I already am not sure of, but we know their returns vary and change in cycles. I would argue that the good returns of these last 3 years, is setting mean reversion up, and returns will drop over the next few years, before then picking up again eventually at some point (though I have no clue when). If you look at steel prices, they are not at pre-pandemic levels (maybe still at a 50% premium to those levels) so it could drop further - steel prices have to revert to the mean too. I was hoping interest rates dropping would rejuvenate demand but I doubt we will see the effects until late 2025, and then only when the improvement in demand translates to sales will we see an improvement in stock prices. It\u2019s not a short term play because of this\n\nI\u2019m at the point now where I still feel Nucor could be a good investment, but with a 10 year timeframe. It\u2019s a good company that will do well, and probably still be dominant. Simply because of mean reversion, I am thinking results will suffer a little the next year or two, before the cycle hopefully turns. Which is why I don\u2019t even want to think about the short term, and just want to hold it till the next peak of the cycle.\n\nThe long term danger to Nucor could well be Steel Dynamics to be honest. They have beaten Nucor in ROCE on average the past 10yrs. I don\u2019t know enough about the company to determine if that is an actual issue or not, but their returns make me wonder. They run electric arc furnaces too, seem to be a lot like Nucor since they originated from Nucor, and are doing well. Nucor\u2019s CEO changed in 2020, and then quickly benefited from the boom in 2021 and 2022, so it\u2019s hard to assess their ability objectively. If they misstep, Steel Dynamics could take advantage. Something to look at before investing - is the dominant position in the US market defensible over the next 10yrs?\n\nWhere I am now: Decided to take a break from the analysis because I realised I was entering a market timing state of mind, trying to figure out when steel prices will bottom out or not - a waste of time that I did not want to let myself do. So I decided to step away\n\nwhenever I go back, i\u2019ll be studying US Steel, Cleveland Cliffs, and Steel Dynamics. But the US steel market is not limited only to US firms, so I will look at POSCO, ArcelorMittal, and maybe some Chinese firms if I can. It would not be a proper analysis without these.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add on with something I read a few minutes ago: In the Fundsmith Owner\u2019s Manual, there is a short discussion on cyclicals, saying that there is an adage to buy when they look expensive, because they are at the bottom of their cycle when they have little or no earnings that will go up as the cycle progresses, and sell when they are cheap, as they have high earnings that will go down as the cycle progresses. Unintuitive but logical. In the manual, though, it is discussed in the context that such cyclicals require market timing and Fundsmith does not want to try timing the market. Wise advice indeed",

It was founded in 2011 (as a successor to the Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC) and is headquartered in NY. It operates the eponymous cable channel and various other PPV channels and streaming platforms (amc+ and others).\n\nMarket Cap: $383.21 million  \nTotal Cash: $802.55 million\u202f  \nTotal Debt: $2.49 billion  \nEnterprise Value (EV): $2,070.66 billion\n\nOCF: $\u202a\u202a424.72\u202fmillion  \nFCF: $395.00\u202fmillion  \nNet income (TTM): \u202a\u202a$58.18 million  \nEBITDA: $1.44 billion\n\nDebt decreased slightly over the last four years, the company pays no dividends.\n\nHistorical net income data:  \n2020: $239.98\u202fmillion  \n2021: $250.60\u202fmillion  \n2022: $7.59\u202fmillion (dent caused by one time restructuring charge)  \n2023: $215.46 million\n\nNominal PE (Market Cap/TTM NI) is 6.6x  \nEV/TTM EBITDA is 2070,66/1440 = 1,44x\n\nShareholders equity is \u202a\u202a$1.05 billion so P/B (Market Cap/Shareholders equity) is 383,21/1050 = 0,36x\n\nCashflow from operating activities has steadily recovered after a drop from 2020 to 2021 (-80.84%) and has doubled TTM ($203.58 in 2023 to $424.72 million TTM). ROE is 5.54% which is low and stems from a low net profit margin of 2.3%.\n\nRisks:\n\n\\*ROE of 5.54% is constrained by high interest expenses because of substantial debt ($2.49 billion) and unusual items (the industry\u2019s average is significantly lower, but competitors like Netflix come in at \\~31%)  \n\\* net profit margin at 2.3% due to non-operating costs  \n\\* the degrowth hypothesis seems more likely at the moment, as revenue forecasts show a declining revenue  \n\\* general sentiment is negative and might drive the price further down, as its short interest already sits at \\~24%\n\nSummary:  \nlow valuation at 6.6x P/E; good FCF; low P/B ratio of 0.36x; profitable; mixed financial strength situation\n\nCatalysts:  \ndebt isn\u2019t increasing but stagnating and the recent rate cut from the Federal Reserve can improve cashflow and debt management (D/E ratio of 2.37); there is still an ongoing transition from cable to streaming from which AMC might profit; AMC and Netflix closed streaming deal in July 2024; the worst case scenario seems to be priced in already;",

AMC has a collection of networks with a long-term record of consistently producing very good shows. However, their cable numbers are declining faster than their streaming is taking off. Furthermore, there is a glut of programming and the streamers are actually ordering less content. They are licensing some content to Netflix, but that does not appear to be turning around their revenues (yet). A long time ago a stock like AMCX would be acquired for its library, so I guess that potential exists except this company is controlled by a family and it will not be sold until they decide to sell. I owned it for a couple of years but missed the one opportunity to sell at a profit (when it was confused with AMC theaters and popped to $80 during the meme stock heyday). Good luck, however.",

The company noted that demand may moderate in the second half of 2024 due to the macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer spending patterns. This uncertainty in demand could lead to fluctuating revenues and affect the overall financial stability of the company.\n\nThe demand for image sensors remains healthy in China but is relatively tepid in the rest of the world due to cautious consumer spending.\n\nAxcelis is investing significantly in the Advanced Logic market, which is still in the nascent stage. This multi-year effort is unlikely to yield immediate returns, and there is inherent risk in the company's strategy to gain market share in this underpenetrated area. Long cycles and uncertain adoption rates could delay financial benefits.\n\n*ACLS Issues Underwhelming Guidance*\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, ACLS estimates revenues of approximately $255 million, which suggests a 12.7% decline from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be $1.43, which represents a 28.1% decline from prior year actuals.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be slightly above the third quarter.
