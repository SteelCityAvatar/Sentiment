Kudos to [r/PaperBagInvestor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaperBagInvestor/) PBI Daniel Schreiber CEO complimented his analysis of Lemonade Insurance $LMND. If you are an investor and want to consider carefully PBI LMND Analysis. $LMND is one of the top AI investments in Stock Market (Softbank Masa Son is the biggest shareholder for good reason).

I would also note CAC Customer Acquisition Costs does not factor in $LMND monetization of Chewy Deal which gives $LMND access to 20M Pet Customers for no cash up front. Chewy is incentivized with up to 4.99% stock options. Note Pet Customers are a great entry into profitable insurance customers that $LMDN can then cross sell other insurance products aka unleash the Power of Insurance Bundle PoIB. GEICO and $ROOT do not have the power of PoIB. No cash up front $LMND sign up Pet Insurance Customers then unleash the PoIB.

PBI CAC does not factor in Lemonade Insurance $LMND Metromile Acquisition AUTO Insurance impact. $LMND bought 1M Auto Insurance customers for less then cash, in other words $LMND picked up more cash then the cost of the MILE Metromile 2022 acquisition. $LMND also picked up TONS of data on Auto Insurance customers. Less then cash $LMDN has just begun to penetrate the Auto Insurance market primarily because $LMND will only sell profitable insurance products and REG factors have delayed this. CEO does say Auto Insurance will ramp by 2025.

Finally Synthetic Agents SA a deal with General Catalyst one of the top VCs in HARVARD SQUARE CAMBRIDGE MA is a game changer. SA are game changer noted by CEO in PBI interview. READ Daniel Schreiber white paper on SA. For almost no cash up front $LMND wins customers for life less some churn. This is why $LMND has extended SA deal into 2025. Gen Cat picks up a double digit ROI. I like to highlight I see SA spreading to other deals. What investor does not like double digit ROI. I also highlight $LMND thought process is all about building their FlyWheel for the LONG TERM. Unlike the Insurance Agent model that keeps the Insurance Customer for the life time. $LMND Lemonade Insurance keeps the insurance customer for LIFE TIME. More Time MORE Insurance Customers faster the FlyWheel.

Again listen to Daniel Schreiber 33 min into PBI interview address short sellers. It is self explanatory. Schreiber is a lawyer and very cable of shorting through the tilt SEC gives short sellers.

GREAT JOB Mr. PaperBagInvestor!

This is my first post here, I tried to keep it short. Hopefully it will be worth your time and maybe I could get some constructive reflection.

Here I am requesting to all of you to critique my following thesis on one of the business that I recently uploaded on Value Investors Club - Unfortunately, it Got declined (which might be deservedly so) - I am just 1.5 years into value principles/concepts yet, I know there is long runway to cover and learn - I am really interested in Value investing and in general lives of value investors - where investors like Lilu & Mohnish build capital and spend it on society through their charitable activities and live ethical life. 

Not bragging about what I have learned or What I do but just sharing to get feedback on my loopholes (since I don't have any value investor friends) - I have read some of the books by Peter lynch, Adam Sessel, Bruce Greenwald, William Green, Guy Spier, Howard marks, Chris - Listened to almost all the annual meetings from 1994 to 2023 of Berkshire Hathaway, Listened to 100s of videos on value investing (Compounders to cigar butts) - I think I have made some decent % progress in terms of how to behave - After facing rejection from Value investors club and seeing this reality check, I have been feeling horrible, just got to know about Robert Lou as well.

I hope some of you can provide constructive critique (Please do not unnecessarily roast - I know it is Chinese so take that out of the discussion too). Also, I did saw some people recommended that specific words should be used for VIC as posts are analyzed by Hedge fund managers.

I will be thankful to you guys for reading this and providing me any feedback/comments or whatever you feel like I should be improving - Any reading material/ recommendation... anything. Thank you❤️

**~VIC Post:~**

China Automotive Systems, Inc. is a major supplier of power steering components and systems in the Chinese automotive industry. The company mainly operates through eight Sino-foreign joint ventures. Company’s products include four separate series of power steering with an annual production capacity of 8.0 million sets of steering gears, steering hoses, and columns. The main customers of CAAS include China FAW Group, Dongfeng Auto Group, BYD auto company, Beigi Foton Motor, Cherry Automobile co and Stellantis N.V., and Ford Motor company in North America.

Valuation at 5 years low - Record performance in Revenue of Top and Bottom line – Improved Margins - Solid Balance Sheet

Why? (CHEAP – UGLY – OBSCURE – IGNORED).

**Valuation:**

Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) = Current Assets – Total Liabilities = 508 – 358 = $150M

Net Current Asset Value per share = NCAV/Shares outstanding = $150/$30 = Approx. $5.00 NCAV

As of today 4/16/2024, = PE 2.78, Forward PE 5.33, ROE = 11.50%, ROA = 5.20%, ROIC = 8.77%, P/B 0.31, PS 0.18, Debt/EBIT -0.44.

**\*As of 31 December 2023: (Shares outstanding 30.19 million) – Market Cap – Ranging Around $100 Million\***

**Balance Sheet Assets:**

Cash and Cash Equivalent **=** $166.00 Million ($40 Million Pledged)

Total Current Assets = $564.08 Million

Total non-current Assets = $202.37 Million

**Liabilities:**

Current Liabilities = $383.74 Million (A/c Payable - $253 Million & Current Debt $48.21 Million – Justified more than the protection of A/c receivable and Cash on hand).

Long-term Liabilities = $14.28 Million out of which $1.27 Mill long term debt and all others non-current liabilities.

**Income Statement**: As of 31 December, 2023:

Revenue = $576.35 Million (2024 – Guidance $605.00 Million)

Gross Profit = $103.76 Million

EBIT - $43.82 Million - Pretax Income = $42.8M – Net Income = $37.66 M

EPS – $1.25 (Best in last 5 years)

Margins = Gross 18.00% - Profit Margin – 6.53% (Best in last 5 years and expected to improve)

**About Management:**

- 64.73% is owned by Insiders (Chairman holds majority)

- Since 12 April 2022 Management has bought back about a Million shares and spent $5 Million – CFO Mr. Jie Lie stated ""Our stock's market capitalization is well below our combined cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, our working capital, our book value, and the valuations of a number of peer companies focused on multiple financial factors.  The share repurchase commits our strong financial position to support shareholder value.""

- Last year 16 November, Mr. Jie lie bought 6,000 shares - $19,200 – CFO has a trend from 2018 to buy shares when they are oversold and sell when overbought.

- On 3/28/2024 Last month's earning call – CFO stated “Balance sheet has cash which itself is $5.50 per share and Current ratio of 1.5

CAAS has a relatively stable business and attractive value opposite to its main Peers like Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. KNDI (PE ratio 72.67/Bad margins, losing money) ECARX Holdings, Inc. ECX (Horrible Balance sheet, Share delusion).

In my opinion, HEADS I WIN, TAILS I DON’T LOOSE MUCH.

There’s a ton of low multiple chinese stocks, even ones in less cyclical industries, some even trading below cash. Why is this any different?

Basically this reads to me like you want to buy a chinese auto supplier because it’s at a low multiple, and I don’t see any unique insights or perspectives. Buying a stock because it has a low multiple is not a thesis.

At first glance their balance sheet looks pretty good. 52bn in equity and 40bn in debt, which is a respectable leverage ratio.

But 130bn of their assets are intangibles. I presume this is mostly from brands which they previously acquired/created.

If we were to ignore their intangible assets, the balance sheet wouldn't look so rosy at all.

Now obviously it wouldn't be reasonable to ignore them entirely, but I feel they're not worth as much as tangible assets like property and equipment would be.

End of the day, unless the business is actually going to liquidate, or is going to be acquired for its assets, I think asset valuations are pretty useless. Cash flows are what matters.

That also means you should remove (add back) amortization or impairment of these intangibles for any P/E or P/FCF in most cases. The exception would be if they have something like software development being capitalised then amortized - that is a real cost."

First, businesses that are capital intensive in terms of long-term tangible assets will have to replace those assets as they degrade, and have to expand large amounts of cash for new capital assets in order to scale revenue. You depreciate tangible assets at capitalized prices, but you have to replace equipment at higher prices thanks to inflation. That means businesses reliant on large amounts of tangible assets to generate revenue always need cash injections. Another way to see it is that your true earnings will be less than the reported net income.

Goodwill results from procuring businesses in excess of their (usually) tangible asset value, which means that the procured business was earning high returns on its tangible assets. Not only will you be able to get tax deductions when amortizing the Goodwill asset - you don't even have to replace them! When Goodwill is fully amortized, you're still left with a great business earning high returns on its tangible assets, and is cheap to scale."

I get that we can base price on cashflows, but the quality of the balance sheet behind those cashflows should surely affect their value. Strong balance sheet companies can take a lot of pain, companies with very weak balance sheets may fail under relatively minor stress. This is more an aside point, but I don't agree with how the market seems to price things at fixed multiples regardless of balance sheet. SBUX being an example.

I also assume it is easier to collateralise tangible assets and borrow against them.

Somebody is willing to loan them more than the value of their tangible assets. That says something about the company. It says something about future cashflows and their dependability. Credit investors are not risk-lovers by nature. The bondholders aren't nervous for a reason. Running a company on negative equity is a huge vote of confidence by its financiers. Somewhat similarly, running a business sustainably on negative working capital is a great achievement: your customers and suppliers have gone from a net use of capital to a net source of it. Getting paid before you deliver a product or service is a very powerful benefit. Buybacks can result in negative equity situations, and all the better for it. If no equity is required to run and expand a profitable business, the returns on it are technically infinite. Capital-efficiency is not a crime.

Saying a balance sheet is shambolic or disastrous because of its reliance on intangible assets, negative equity, or negative WC is quite an unsound generalization."

Yep you're absolutely right. I was rather abstracting it back to theory in order to illustrate the advantages of  intangible assets. To determine if the goodwill is a fair amount, you'd have to evaluate the discounted cash flows of the acquired businesses too, and public data may not be available.

Yeah this is what I was getting at with questioning how good they are. I don't feel they are as good as tangible assets like property or equipment. But nor should they be disregarded entirely. They do have some real value, otherwise they wouldn't be there. What is the correct way to 'adjust' them is the question.

I agree, but I don't feel that's really the case with SBUX. They have $5bn in operating income and $25bn in debt. How would you quantify at what point it becomes dangerous?

It isn't only danger, it's also the cost, and likely future increase in cost. An extra 5% on $25bn would be $1.25bn, which is 30% of their net income, so significant. It might not increase that much, but they would feel even lesser increases.

To me, a lot of companies are still running on easy money mode, and at risk if we hit testing conditions. I would rather avoid companies with weak balance sheets unless I see good compensation in the price."

If BATS buy a company with book value of $10bn for $50bn, the company's assets are brought into their accounts at book value of $10bn, and $40bn of goodwill is created to reflect the difference between market and book price. This supposes BATS paid a fair price, and the target company really is worth $50bn, and so should be recognised as an asset of that value.

In reality, it looks like they misjudged at least one of these deals, and it has subsequently come to light that company is not worth $50bn, but $30bn. In that case, they are obliged to reduce the amount of goodwill on their books 

Intangible assets can also include things like brand names, copyrights, intellectual property. Sometimes the company is able to create these internally, in which case they would be under 'other intangibles'.

96,Alternatives to Writing Investment Theses on Seeking Alpha,2024-04-20 00:39:35,5.0,"I've had a 44 articles and a blog post in the past that I've posted on Seeking Alpha.

The issue I'm having with posting my investment thesis on Seeking Alpha is major clashes with editors and an overall unsophisticated audience.

Recently for example I spend countless hours on an article which got rejected. Some of the things the editor said would make people on this subreddit go crazy such as saying that I should look at the operational performance of the company based on EBITDA rather operating income (Charlie Munger would be rolling in his grave).

These sorts of things in the past has lead me to not be able to post my views on Seeking Alpha. In many ways the straw has broken the camels back and I'm now looking other areas where I can post investment ideas.

While I can make my own substack there would be practically no one reading. So instead I'm wondering if someone here in the community knows places where people can make write-ups about their investment theses in a more free manner than a place like Seeking Alpha.

I was doing some research on companies and found some possible funny business with this business. Before I go further I am not trying to suggest a short. I just wanted someone else to take a look and see what they thought. 

  
In short, NOBH is a company that sells modular homes in florida, lower cost it seems. They seem to make around 100 of these a quarter and sell to individuals, and other companies that go on to sell them (wholesale portion of the business). It came up on my screener for ROIC, EBIT Margin and revenue growth and I never trust screeners. I immediately went to find their annual report and found some 8-Ks alluding to the fact that the 10-K was delayed due to an ongoing audit: ""**Form 10-K will be delayed because of the ongoing financial audit, whereby most of the remaining in-process audit procedures relate to the capitalization of costs in finished goods inventory""**. 

My understanding of this was that perhaps they are capitalizing inventories and in this way putting off these as expenses on the income statement. I further learned that the chairman owns over 50% of the shares and for the last 6 years they have been paying one-time dividends, but have no dividend policy. These dividends seem to be paid out of their fairly large horde of cash (market cap of 115M or so and dividends of 2-5M with cash and short term investments currently hanging around 30M). 

Just made me wonder if there is something off where they are capitalizing inventories to make income look better and in the meantime paying themselves the pile of cash slowly while in truth the business is in dire straights, income wise.

From how I read that sentence, it suggests they have been capitalising costs which they should not have capitalised, and hence their balance sheet assets will be overstated, and their past P&Ls will have been overstated too

> Just made me wonder if there is something off where they are capitalizing inventories

Inventories are capitalised, they are assets. It is the costs associated with the production of inventories where things can get sticky. Some of those costs should be immediately put through the P&L as a loss, but a dishonest manager may instead put them on the balance sheet as assets, avoiding the loss and overstating assets."

130,Netflix Profits Grow As Subscribers Grow,2024-04-19 19:46:55,9.0,"Everyone thought it was the end for the streaming giant once Netflix began cracking down on password sharing. Users of the platform were so used to leaching off of friends or passing on their information to friends and family, but now the conglomerate was making us pay $6.99 to $22.99 a month to use the platform. Well, it looks like consumers gave in.

**The Result**

Millions of new subscribers as Netflix, still the dominant player in the streaming world, added 9 million subscribers in the past three months, hitting a new record high of 269.9 million subscribers. The company also reported $9.37 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $5.28 for the first quarter.

These are big numbers.

While the current subscriber additions topped Wall Street estimates, the company is still reeling from market reactions to its blowout fourth-quarter report when Netflix only added 13 million subscribers for the entire quarter. 

This led the company to [announce ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflix-stock-slips-after-streamer-says-it-wont-share-subscriber-numbers)

its plans to stop sharing quarterly subscriber numbers in 2025. By doing so, the company is covering its bases in case a major decline in subscriber growth were to happen again, as it absolutely decimated its stock the last time it happened.

The company is innovating its revenue model and adding new features, such as advertising. Many of these features have different impacts on KPIs and metrics investors often hold dear when evaluating the company. In order to avoid having major impacts and swings every quarter with the release of growth metrics, the company has decided to keep them on an annual basis. This prevents volatility in its stock price and valuation while also allowing the company to “quit while it's ahead” and keep its position as the subscriber champion among its rivals. 

The company is likely predicting that the growth in subscribers will likely eventually recede as they continue to ebb closer and closer to market saturation. The boost from paid subscribers will likely fade in the next couple of quarters as users switch to personal accounts. 

**Netflix's Reinvention**

Not long ago, investors remembered the brand struggling to keep up with its rising competitors. Well, this is not the case anymore. 

The company’s first-quarter letter to shareholders displayed several goals that the brand was looking to reach, one of them being to “sustain healthy growth long term” and “improve the variety and quality of entertainment.” 

What did Netflix mean by this?

Simply speaking, the platform wants to introduce more great TV shows and movies, plus a stronger slate of games and must-watch live programming. In recent months, Netflix has expanded into live sports entertainment. In February, the platform aired its first-ever live awards show and followed that up with a 10-year deal to air “WWE Raw” live. That deal was valued at more than $5 billion.

In terms of gaming, Netflix has gotten more creative. The company partnered with Rockstar Games, the producer of “Grand Theft Auto.” This wildly popular video game franchise is set to release its 6th game, touted to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time. 

However, not all has been peachy for Netflix, as last month’s Oscars was a big disappointment. Though the streaming service continues to lead its rivals in terms of nominations, the platform only took home one award for best live-action short film. Going forward, it looks as if the company is moving away from the core of its business, spending mountains of money to develop the world’s best big-budget films and TV shows to win these awards. 

While this has worked in the past, a change in strategy is needed. After the explosion in popularity of its show “Suits,” the company has decided to enact a new plan of licensing its content to other studios. New generations of users are discovering iconic shows from the '90s and early 2000s, such as “Seinfeld” and “Sex and the City” after the show was featured on the Netflix Platform. 

This allows Netflix to license older content that the platform isn’t planning to continue with to rivals for large payouts, adding another source of revenue for the company. 

**New Subscriber Tier**

Netflix’s new cheaper subscriber tier has found great adoption and success. The ad tier, which costs just $6.99 per month in the United States, is less than Netflix’s other subscription plans and has seen explosive growth. The major difference between this model and its existing, more expensive tier is the introduction of ads. Advertisements are another way for the company to make money, as the platform is sought after by companies for its immense reach. These ads allow the company to offset its costs and provide the tier at a discounted price to its users. 

Currently, the Netflix ad tier has more than 23 million users, growing roughly 65% quarter-over-quarter.

I'm curious, what does ValueInvesting think of Netflix?

Last Q they spent a ton on marketing and boosting their subs which allowed for this Q, I expected a blowout based on this but also expected the great sub counts and their implied growth to be temporary, putting them into a position to do something in the future. The market (mistakenly in my opinion) puts too much emphasis on sub counts, you can calculate what a sub count should result in with money but there is an implied risk in doing so. Buffett when speaking on sub counts states that ""they aren't money"" and that they're not standardized between competitors, you can have free and discounted ones included to inflate your numbers and justify it based on cost vs benefit. 

It's a parallel in terms of the rationality to the arguments that state we will all be buying and driving electric vehicles in the next decade and oil demand will finally peak in the medium term future. If you think about what you're paying for now, you're paying for immense growth up to where it is assumed sub counts should double in the next half decade (and revenues, profits, and such) conservatively, meaning somewhere in the realm of 10% of the world population or so will have Netflix. Not factoring how many people don't have access to internet, electricity, money (below poverty line), and any competition. They have expanded to most lucrative regions available. 

I think these are possibly a few reasons explaining why they want to take the focus off sub counts and focus mainly on financials. 

Competition has been pouring well over $15B+ catching up to Netflix over the last few years, if you look at Disney and factor Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+, they amount to around the same subs as Netflix. The smaller streamers are growing rapidly relative to Netflix and are in the process of cleaning up margins to match them, by 2028 they should be on the same levels for most. Theres also pressure for consolidation which is a serious threat. Netflix has a first movers advantage but it won't last forever, and although I only loosely believe in moats I think there's isn't a real moat there. People will argue about content from one is trash and another is better, but as investors we should care more about the numbers, with those being dollars first and sub counts next. The dollars earned will reflect the quality just fine, don't even need to watch it for myself."

The probability war would occur is very low, and does not explain the very different performances across different Chinese ADRs. You may disagree and think they are all out of bounds - fair enough.

Political risks are also different by company. PDD's share price surge last year was significantly driven by growth from Temu - which is highly sensitive to import tariff risk (if the $800 de minimis duty free quota for the US is removed), much more so than Alibaba.

The above and much more context are more fully fleshed out in the post."

That is not true, the shitfest in terms of stock price has been caused by Russian invasion, look at Hang Seng index. The big crash down literally starts with the Russian invasion date. Many Chinese stocks where majority holders were foreigners are extremelly beaten down, in contrast to Chinese SOE's which were usually not held by foreigners (for example like China Petroleum). Many investment managers have sold Chinese stocks, and since BABA was in lots of ETFs, it went down as well. You can look for another examples like Tencent, Baidu.

I am myself anecdotal proof of that, as I have limited my Chinese exposure after the invasion.

>The probability war would occur is very low

How could you possibly know that. You know, the narrative they wont invade Taiwan because that would be stupid was used with Russia as well. I have no idea how big the risk is. I mean I've tried to determine that - I even tried to read the book about Xi Jingpin and I still have no idea. Xi Jingpin literally says in the open they might take Taiwan with force. Even Putin didnt say that about Ukraine.

I want the risk to be low, I hold Chinese stocks, but I am really hesitant to add more because of the Taiwan invasion. This risk, if materialized, will lead to -100 % on all Chinese positions. 

And it is absurd when it is not mentioned in stock talk. Chinese government and economic policy is considered major risk, while they literally say they want to support free market. But when Xi Jingpin says he might take Taiwan with force - no we dont have to even mention that..."

Well obviously there was crash before the war, but it really went into absurd numbers when the war started. I cannot know why majority of people sold the Chinese stocks at that time, but I know that foreigners sold the stocks. Lots of SOE's are doing well. I vividly remember when the invasion started, all of Chinese tech went into all time low, while stocks like Bank of China, China petroleum were doing fine. I was actually really scared to invest at that time, it even looked that China could help the Russia or even invade the Taiwan simultaneously."

Interesting website. 

I would use it for stuff that needs to be searched individually, eg. insider buys,  but i would not use it to make investment decisions especially when it comes to valuation. 

eg, your valuation of $SNA is off (in the DCF section), this year is not a good year for snap-on, the ceo said that it may take a while for their tools division sales growth to come back to normal. However your tool is very bullish about the stock.

Can you imagine someone looking at SNA on your website, and sees that the price is 268 and your IV on the stock is 354 and thinks to his/herself that the stock is cheap and goes ahead and buys it. When m* has a IV of 260 and CFRA has a SELL and a 12 month target of 250, and then other more optimistic analysts on your website has a max 12 month target price of 313 (your website, under the analyst section).

if you want to be more credible in your DCF, you should have these 3 pieces of information: what is the growth assumption, what is terminal value and what is the discount rate.   That way, you state it up front so that readers know your assumptions."

With FMP api, it's not hard to create one as you just do the frontend and call FMP api which provides you with price, financials, valuation, transcripts etc.

It's very tempting to take this shortcut, esp for a solo developer, as it saves you the hard work of scraping and building your own database and backend.

However, this is not the way to build a valuable service. There is little value add beyond repeating the same API data that everyone has. And it deprives you of real value add services.

Investment analysis is data driven. You need to control your database and backend to create something proprietary to you."

You may think you have a twist, but from what I can see, the differentiator is insufficient/not meaningful.

I would also be careful about who you ask for advice.  Investing is such a big industry that you cannot develop features for everyone.  What type of investor are you trying to appeal to?  For example, I am a fundamental stock analyst.  So the only thing that interests me on your site is the stock screener, snapshot of the company, and then I go off to do my own in-depth research (go through sec filings, industry material, etc.).  I don't need anything fancy.

For example, I have paid $ for gurufocus, TIKR, and bamsec on-and-off over the years.  Gurufocus for their stock screener (I don't think your stock screener is comparable). Bamsec for doing filing searches.  TIKR for their international companies (I would not have paid if they only had US companies).  I don't think it is realistic for me to ask you to develop a stock screener like gurufocus or filing search capability like bamsec - again, you cannot compete on all fronts.  You are probably closest to TIKR, so maybe that is something to think about.  But the TIKR space (baby Bloomberg wannabes) is very crowded.  Just my 2 cents.

184,Here are some key takeaways from the Dhando Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns (I highly recommend reading this book),2024-04-19 09:13:01,14.0,"Hey, since people enjoyed my last post I thought I'd share with you a fantastic concept from Mohnish Pabrai.

**Introducing Mohnish Pabrai & His Investment Philosophy: ""The Dhando Investor""**

I'd like to share some insights about Mohnish Pabrai, a renowned value investor, and his book **""The Dhando Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns""**.

---

**Mohnish’s Background**

Mohnish Pabrai is a seasoned investor and the founder of Pabrai Investment Funds, which he started in 1999 after a career as a software engineer. While exact figures are hard to come by, sources report that his fund has consistently returned over 20% per year.

Despite the challenge in verifying these returns, Mohnish's reputation as an investor, and his associations with Warren Buffett and his idol, the late Charlie Munger, underscore his credibility in the investment world.

---

**Dhando Investing and Risk**

The book delves into various aspects of value investing, but a standout point for me—and particularly relevant in today’s Investing Chronicle—is Pabrai’s perspective on risk:

> ""Heads I win, Tails I don’t lose much"" - **Mohnish Pabrai**

This simple yet profound statement captures the essence of risk management: limit your downside so that even if you're wrong, your losses are manageable. But if you're right, the rewards can be substantial.

---

**You Won’t Always Be Right**

Pabrai emphasizes realism in his expectations. He admits that even he, with all his experience, expects only about 60% of his investments to succeed. If a veteran investor like him braces for a 40% error rate, it’s wise for us to adopt a similar mindset.

The key isn't to always be right but to ensure that our losses are minimal when we're wrong.

---

**How do we do that?**

At the heart of Pabrai’s investment strategy is the principle of a margin of safety. This involves buying stocks at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, creating a buffer against potential losses. This strategy might already sound familiar to those versed in value investing!

The good news? Now you know how to apply these principles too!

The Dhandho Investor” is a great read. It presents the concepts of value investing in a very easy-to-understand format, leaving you with more confidence in your ability to be a successful investor.

Buybacks are more tax efficient. There's 0 taken out for taxes so you can utilize more cash.

If you get a dividend you need to find another investment. AMR has 15% FCF yields being paid out. Can I find another such investment? No, I'm happy withy cash being used to buy part of that cash.

You cover the biggest ones here. Another one that is not as significant but never talked about is the cashflow economics of dividends. For a company paying a quarterly dividend, there are generally 2 weeks x 4 quarters = 8 weeks per year, or ~15% of the year your stock is trading ex-dividend: ie, you are extending the company an interest-free 'shareholder' loan.

The money you are owed shows up neither in the share price nor your bank account. Obviously, it is yours in an accounting sense, which is important. However, you cannot reinvest it yet. You must wait. So, multiply the dividend yield by the ~15% of the year you are loaning your company money, and you get the total unwitting cash holding due to dividend paying, as a percentage of your capital employed. Multiply this by the going rate on cash. (If you're debt free, use the Treasury rate. If you've got a 10% LOC, use 10%.) This is the total cash drag on your returns from holding dividend-payers.

It might not be huge. For instance, even a company yielding a 6% dividend, paying out quarterly, represents only an unwitting cash holding of 0.8%. At going rates on cash, that's a 0.04% hit to your returns. If your opportunity cost is paying down a 10% LOC, it's still only 0.08%. That said, who would voluntarily accept something in the range of a 0.1% hit to their annual returns? People will move funds over a MER difference of 0.1%.

Combine this with the other drags you listed, and there is a significant negative expected value to receiving returns as dividends rather than share price appreciation."

Also, you can't discount the extra buying pressure applied by a huge player in the market. Say a company buys back stock regularly.

Conversely, you can find dislocated buying opportunities when that major buyer is out of the market. For instance, a small Canadian company (~$8M CAD current market cap) that I held until yesterday ran out of its buyback authorization halfway through the year (the 'year', for these purposes, began on June 30, 2023). So, for the past several months, there hasn't been a major buyer that was willing to pay up to 10c/share as recently as last year. They recently acquired a company about ~15% of their size and brought the net margins up from ~15% to ~60%. Nada reflected in the price. I was able to snag a small block of shares at 6.5c and another, smaller one at 7.5c a couple days later. Prior to this I had perhaps 5% of my final position, but the price didn't make any sense. I had paid 9c for that initial holding just months before, and I was happy to hold it until the summer (or later), as the improved earnings rolled in. After those two buys, I had an average of ~7c/share. It then steadily rose to 9.5c, beginning just days after these bigger buys.

I only dumped it yesterday to fund two more promising long-term names than had been actually affected by the recent corrective price action. The quotation on this company didn't change, and I was able to exit the entire position at 9c. I think the benefit of those cheap prices would have been obtained by the shareholders, as a whole, and not just me, if they had any remaining shares authorized for buyback.

&nbsp;

That sounds like responsible management. Was it a special dividend? Or is their dividend policy more variable as a whole? I just perused their annual cashflow statements (past 5 years) and it seems the dividend has not been consistent (if anything, this is a good thing)."

=================================

  
Amazingly enough, adult investors, both individuals and so-called professionals, act the same way when things go bump in the market. We have seen markets fall time and again because of some political or economic announcement. Likewise, individual stocks and sectors often fall on weaker than expected earnings or unforeseen events. As prices fall, at exactly the time investors should be sharpening their pencils to select stocks to buy at lower prices, they join the panic and run down the hall for the unreasonable security of a cash position. Risk is more often in the price you pay than the stock itself.  
  
I have seen many market sell-offs over the span of my career, including major declines such as the 1972 to 1974 bear market caused by higher oil prices and a stagflated economy, the crash of 1987, the minicrash of 1989 and the high-yield bond debacle that followed, the Asian flu culminating in a brief panic in the United States in 1998, and the 2001 to 2002 market implosion. In each case, the rapid decline of prices brought bargain issues that an investor could buy for a lot less than their precollapse price. As others around you are selling in reaction to news reports, you can load up the shelves of your store with value opportunities that can benefit from the subsequent price recoveries. It is important to understand that the prices of solid companies with strong balance sheets and earnings usually recover. In my experience, if the fundamentals are sound, they always have and they always will.  
  
As with the other characteristics that are sources of value opportunities for the shelves of our store, there has been an enormous amount of research into the results achieved by buying markets, stocks, countries, and sectors that have gone bump in the night. From 1932 to nearly the present, the studies confirm that when bad things happen to good companies, they recover—and usually quite nicely in a reasonable amount of time. It has also been shown that high performance seems to beget lower returns, and low performance leads to higher returns in nearly all markets from the United States and Canada to Japan and Europe (see ""Don't Take My Word for It""). Today's worst stocks become tomorrow's best stocks, and the darlings of the day turn into tomorrow's spinsters.

## Netflix's Strategic Evolution: Subscriber Surge and New Business Directions

Netflix has added a substantial 9.3 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2024, reaching a global total of 269.6 million, despite a decrease in stock prices post-announcement. This growth is credited to the enforcement of individual account creation from password sharers, an introduction of an ad-supported tier, and diversification into live sports and video games. This shift signifies a strategic evolution aimed at long-term growth and diversification of revenue sources, marking a move away from solely big-budget films.

## Netflix to Cease Reporting Subscriber Numbers in Favor of Financial Health Metrics

Starting in Q1 2025, Netflix will stop reporting its quarterly membership and average revenue per membership numbers, transitioning to focus on key performance indicators such as revenue, operating margin, and user engagement. This shift reflects a strategic move to highlight financial health and profitability over subscriber quantity, potentially influencing broader industry reporting standards.

## Continuous Price Increases: Netflix's Flexible Subscriber Value Proposition

Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters has suggested that there is no upper limit to how high subscription fees might go, emphasizing a value-based approach rather than competing against traditional pay TV pricing. As Netflix enriches its entertainment offerings, periodic fee increases are anticipated to sustain a cycle of quality content provision. This flexible pricing strategy could affect subscription growth and overall customer satisfaction.

## Netflix After Hours: Stock Dip Contrasts with Solid Financials

Despite positive earnings that exceeded expectations and a 16% subscriber increase, Netflix's stock fell by 3% in after-hours trading as it announced plans to overhaul its reporting strategy. The decision disconnects future reporting from subscription figures to emphasize core financial metrics, signaling a mature phase of business.

 It's a small cap UK serial acquirer in the premium bathroom & kitchen supply industry. They also have a S-Africa branch that owns a big plumbing company along other things. Low debt at just 0,9x ebidta (decreased from 1,2x just one year ago), 8x FCF multiple and 6% dividend yield (0% UK withholding tax) with just 33% payout ratio. The reason for depressed valuation is low liquidity and a massive pension scheme liability on the balance sheet. This is massively overblown though, because even though the scheme is larger than their own market cap, it has a net surplus since 2023 and the average member age is 76 (scheme was closed to new entrants 10 years ago). It's a legacy drag that will resolve on its own. In the meantime the company is compounding (they have strong ROCE + very good acquisition track record). On top of that, they are undervalued by a long shot even without a lot of future growth priced it. The 6% div yield (and there is a DRIP program) is a nice return while you wait for this to happen. 9% is the average CAGR for S&P500. If Norcros share price grows by 3% CAGR you'll even that result, and 3% is an absolute bear cash scenario with basically no growth or an economic crisis that kills the pension plan.

(TSXV: BWCG, OTC:BWCGF), shared insights into the potential of the company at the Metals Investor Forum in Toronto and highlighted the indispensability of essential commodities like gold.   
  
Lekstrom, who has 17 years of experience  in the mining industry, shared the three fundamental pillars of the company: leadership, capital structure, and catalysts.  
  
Blackwolf is strategically positioned in the prolific Golden Triangle Mining region, further amplifying its potential, buoyed by high-grade gold discoveries and ongoing exploration efforts.  
  
The company's flagship project, Niblack, boasts a substantial 6 million ton VMS deposit, rich in gold and copper.   
  
A NI 43-101 compliant resource assessment for Blackwolf's flagship project, Niblack, was finalized on the project in 2023, encompassing the project's Lookout and Trio deposits. At a US$100 cut-off, the resource includes:  
\- Lookout: 5.391 million tonnes classified as Indicated, with grades of 0.92% copper, 1.88 g/t gold, 1.72% zinc, 30 g/t silver, and 159 thousand tonnes categorized as Inferred, with grades of 0.93% copper, 1.63 g/t gold, 1.31% zinc, and 18 g/t silver.  
\- Trio: 460 thousand tonnes classified as Indicated, with grades of 1.16% copper, 1.3 g/t gold, 1.75% zinc, and 20 g/t silver, and 55 thousand tonnes categorized as Inferred, with grades of 0.91% copper, 1.2 g/t gold, 1.9% zinc.  
  
All known mineralization zones remain open for expansion and are situated within a favorable felsic volcanic horizon extending over 2km beyond previous exploration boundaries on the property.  
  
The company also has the backing of prolific investor and billionaire Frank Giustra who not only controls a 13.4% share of the company.  
  
With a solid financial footing—bolstered by $5.3 million in reserves and a prudent expenditure strategy—Blackwolf stands poised to capitalize on its burgeoning portfolio and propel toward production.

**Request**: Use AI to figure out what is the management guidance of EPS for the year. 

**Specifically**: Best case: EPS Growth for the year if new, or a confirmation of the EPS for the year. Worst case: revenue growth and margins nos.  Full year is preferred over half-year, and over quarterly.

**Rationale**: 

I see growth as a component of 3 parts: a. past track record, b. what analysts are estimating and c. what management is forecasting. I can easily find out a. and b., but management forecasts comes from a variety of places. The most obvious is the earnings announcement, presentation and the conference call. Sometimes the company will issue a special announcement mid-quarter, especially if the nos arent forthcoming. It is a long process to go through this, and sometimes, the management will speak in a roundabout way to come to the point on the growth. If you could train the AI to get the management guidance nos, you have something which a lot of people will find useful.

**Proposed Test case:** Test it out on Hershey $HSY. Management originally forecasted some range of nos for sales and earnings, then as the cocoa prices increased, competition became fierce and the company now wants to spend more on SG&A to compete, hence they reissued new guidance for the year. 

(**mandatory disclaimer:** of course no one can predict the future, hence it is important to triangulate these three pieces of growth information, take a discount to the numbers and then make an informed decision.)"

280,"Joel Greenblatt's Magic formula is a very powerful screening technique (from ""The little book that beats the market"")",2024-04-18 13:17:16,24.0,"Hey, this was an insightful read when I read it many years ago and thought I'd share it here. 

Here it goes. 


One particularly powerful screening technique is Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula. In his book, *“The Little Book That Beats the Market,”* Greenblatt argues that amateur investors can outperform the market by investing in a portfolio of stocks selected using his “Magic Formula”, which ranks companies based on quality and value metrics.


**Let’s dive into the process:**

**The Magic Formula**

1. **Define Your Universe of Stocks**  
Begin by defining the universe of stocks from which you’ll construct your portfolio. Currently, my universe comprises all US-listed companies, but you can define your own. You may choose to invest only in companies with a minimum market cap or stocks that trade a minimum daily volume, or perhaps you prefer UK-listed companies. The choice is yours.

Below I walk you through a simple example of how the Magic Formula ranking process works using all the constituents of the S&P 500. For each company I have populated the necessary metrics and rank them showing you the top 5 for each step below.

2. *Rank According to Quality* 
Next, rank each business in your universe based on quality. Greenblatt’s formula uses a metric called Return on Capital (ROC), which measures the amount a company earns per dollar it invests. A higher ROC indicates a stronger incentive for the company to reinvest back into the business.

ROC is calculated as follows:

    ROC = EBIT / (Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital)

Once you have each company’s ROC, rank them from highest to lowest as per the example below:

    | Company        | Ticker | ROC    | Rank - ROC |
    |----------------|--------|--------|------------|
    | Public Storage | PSA    | >1000% | 1          |
    | Verisign       | VRSN   | 486.2% | 2          |
    | Mastercard     | MA     | 418.4% | 3          |
    | Netflix        | NFLX   | 404.2% | 4          |
    | Broadcom       | AVGO   | 222.9% | 5          |

*The table above represents the 5 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest ROC. It is for illustrative purposes only, and data should not be relied upon*

*Measure for Value*

Greenblatt advocates using the Earnings Yield as a measure of value. This metric reflects a company’s earnings from an operating perspective and is less prone to manipulation than net income. Think of earnings yield as similar to an interest rate, and is calculated as follows:

    Earnings Yield = EBIT / Enterprise Value

Once you have each company’s yield, rank the companies from highest to lowest based on this metric.

    | Company        | Ticker | Earning Yield | Rank - Yield |
    |----------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
    | APA Corporation| APA    | 22.2%         | 1            |
    | Valero Energy  | CLU    | 19.7%         | 2            |
    | Bunge Global   | BG     | 19.4%         | 3            |
    | Fox Corp       | FOX    | 17.4%         | 4            |
    | HP Inc.        | HPQ    | 14.6%         | 5            |

*The table above represents the 5 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest Earnings Yield. It is for illustrative purposes only, and data should not be relied upon*

4. **Building the Portfolio**  
Once you have completed the initial rankings, it’s time to construct your portfolio. Combine the ROC and Earnings Yield rankings to create a Total Ranking. Order the Total Ranking from lowest to highest

The next step is to purchase the 20 - 30 companies with the LOWEST Total Ranking and hold them for exactly one year in equal proportions. Based on our example, the portfolio has the following 5 companies:

    | Company        | Ticker | Total Rank | Weighting |
    |----------------|--------|------------|-----------|
    | Omnicom Group  | OMC    | 33         | 3.5%      |
    | HP Inc.        | HPQ    | 33         | 3.5%      |
    | Altria         | MO     | 40         | 3.5%      |
    | Match Group    | MTCH   | 82         | 3.5%      |
    | General Mills  | GIS    | 95         | 3.5%      |

*The table above represents the 5 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest Total Ranking. It is for illustrative purposes only, and data should not be relied upon*

At the end of the year, you repeat the process above and adjust your portfolio accordingly. It’s that simple.

Of course, there will be years of underperformance, but consistency is key. If followed diligently, Greenblatt’s evidence suggests you will outperform the relevant benchmark, e.g., if you are investing in US stocks, you will outperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

A problem I had with it was earnings that were being skewed by something irregular. E.g. sudden gains from dumping some assets or something not in the normal course of business. So such a company may had done poorly in the past but appeared very profitable for a year or two. So this led me to buy shares in such companies that ultimately plummeted in future periods when they ran out of these sudden gains or income sources outside normal course of operations.

2nd problem - some companies rely on very few assets to generate high earnings - e.g., non capital intensive service companies. Or you bump into holding companies or trusts that are publicly listed. Need to compare to industry peers in these cases and investigate whether you're really investing into that business or just some fund that contains a whole bunch of other eggs that warrant more looking into.

So I've been reading into each of the companies I find with the criteria - e.g., paying attention to companies with inconsistent earnings performance."

It tells you how much *cash you need to physically execute an acquisition*, not what you are actually paying.

Example:

A simple company ABC starts with $100M in cash from owners.  The market cap and fair value of ABC is $100M.  EV is $0.  Is the firm worth zero?  Absolutely not.

They buy an extremely stable company with consistent profits called Steady XYZ for $10M that is expected to yield similar returns to Treasuries at fair value.  Has the firm's worth changed?

No but EV is now $10M.  If eventually ABC invests all the cash, MC = EV.

Basically EV keeps rising just by purchasing assets.

Companies that use zero leverage and hoard cash (dumb) have seemingly insane earnings to EV yields.  We are not acquirers.  Just because we buy stock in a company doesn't mean we can extinguish all debt and use the cash freely as we wish."

Not sure how to make of this company, Oddity, $ODD. I am just sharing my data.

On the one hand, the company is growing Sales and Earnings like 60+% annualized for the last three years. The 4 rokkers are fantastic. And the company is not expensive for that level of growth level. They are being priced like  a small cap with a 15% discount rate, and only a growth rate of only 15%. It is quite rare to find tech companies profitable when they IPO. 

Their products seem to be legit, and women genuinely like their Foundation product. Their brand is Il Makiage and [Spoiledchild.com](https://Spoiledchild.com). They sell only via online DTC.

On the other hand, the complaints are many, mainly around the billing, the 14-day trial and the cancellation process.

They only IPOed last year. They were funded by L Catterton, Templeton and Fidelity before IPO.

=======================================

I wrote this to someone on $ODD yesterday:

* Cosmopolitan, Elle and several other reviews check out. Everyone loves the foundation. They have 500k five star ratings.



* Short interest is at 15%. What do the shorts know that Investors do not know? Do they think ODD will go the way of another tech driven beauty product $OLPX, which grew from 2019 to 2022 at a CAGR of 68%, missed their target in 2023, and is now a penny stock?

Multiple news outlets have reported that the FTC will file to block the deal.

The EU and Japan have already signed off on this merger.

Shares are currently around $38 a share, which is sub 10x earnings.  Worst case scenario Tapestry walks away or challenges a potential FTC ruling and loses, and you are stuck owning some quality brands at a reasonable price.  Or the deal goes through and you pick up a nice 50% or so.

An arb play is buying (selling) a stock in Europe and selling (buying) it in the US and locking in the arb profit when trading the FX.

What you're describing is a bet on a regulatory outcome. 

You need to multiply your projected profit by percentage probability of the regulator approving the deal, and time to completion to get CAGR 

And then you need to compare that to your investment alternatives.

I'm guessing you don't know the probabilities (though I'm sure the Capri and Tapestry options vol curves might give some idea) and that you don't think in terms of opportunity costs

F.T.C. Said to Consider Blocking Major Fashion MergerRegulators are expected to meet next week to discuss the $8.5 billion deal between Coach’s owner, Tapestry, and Michael Kors’s parent company, Capri Holdings, which would create a U.S. luxury conglomerate.

The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to sue to block a luxury fashion mega merger, Tapestry’s $8.5 billion takeover of Capri Holdings, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

The F.T.C.’s five commissioners are expected to meet next week to discuss the case, a move that could precede a formal vote on whether to file a lawsuit, the people said. The people, who were not authorized to discuss the deliberations, said it was still possible that the agency could opt not to sue.

The deal, intended to bring together labels such as Tapestry’s Coach and Kate Spade with Capri’s Versace and Michael Kors, would create an American luxury conglomerate to compete with European powerhouses like Louis Vuitton’s parent, LVMH, and Kering, the owner of Gucci.

Monopoly cases in the fashion industry are rare, because there is no shortage of new labels looking to undercut legacy brands. “It is the paradigmatic part of the economy where there is ample competition,” said Howard Hogan, the chair of the fashion, retail and consumer practice at the law firm Gibson Dunn.

Investors have increasingly bet against a completion of the deal, which was announced in August: Shares of Capri have fallen more than 20 percent this year, while Tapestry’s have gained 6 percent. (Typically, shares of the target of a takeover gain while shares of the buyer fall.) Capri’s shares slipped further in trading on Wednesday, while Tapestry’s gained.

The F.T.C. has been scrutinizing the deal for months, even as it was approved by regulators in the European Union and Japan. U.S. regulators could argue that putting Michael Kors and Coach under the same roof may limit the need for those brands to compete on price, which could, in turn, make their products more expensive for consumers.Tapestry and Capri could, in turn, point to the rise of upstart brands like Cult Gaia and Aupen, which celebrities like Taylor Swift have helped make popular.

The case may also invite political scrutiny. Regulators sometimes introduce competition lawsuits if they think a case has a particularly strong chance to establish precedent that can be used in future cases, as the Justice Department did three decades ago in its failed effort to block Gillette’s takeover of a luxury fountain pen company, said William Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chair.

But the Tapestry-Capri deal, Mr. Kovacic added, is “not a case that has great appeal as a way of protecting the downtrodden.”

Capitol Forum previously reported that the F.T.C. was leaning toward suing to block the deal."

Stands for the Present Value 10 report which they are all required to produce on an annual base. It splits out their proven and possible reserves.

Most oil & gas business acquisitions are expressed in value in terms of the price paid relative to the value of the PV - 10 report. A rough rule of thumb might be to take a discount between 20-25% to the PV-10 value. 

Buffett's investment in Occidental makes sense when you consider it in relation to their PV-10 value, as well as the fact that Occidental Petroleum's reserves are exclusively in the US, so energy security is a factor at play. All things considered i'd rather those reserves being in the US vs some African country or the Middle East.

Accounting standards and financial statements aren't great for oil & gas / exploration companies as they are routinely forced to make large write downs on capitalized costs of invested assets as commodity prices swing around them. I don't like it but you really have to focus on EBITDA as a better proxy for the underlying cashflow as the reported accounting losses really don't reflect the underlying cashflows of these type of companies.

Typically the recorded accounting costs for these companies bear little resemblance to the economic values from their extraction, so NAV really isn't a great metric to value them off of.

While I think about it, if looking at the PV-10 value, know that all reserves are converted into equivalent barrels of oil, for ease of comparability. This is typically done on the energy equivalence of the energy sources, so gas converting into oil is done by most companies using this ratio: 6,000 cubic feet of gas equals **1 barrel** of oil equivalent (BOE).

However this conversion doesn't reflect the very different market values of oil & gas. Thus in order to replace an actual barrel of oil, depending on the prices of the two commodities, a company might have to theoretically deliver much more (or less) than 6,000 cubic feet of gas to equal 1 barrel of oil.

The result of this is if converting reserves using the 6:1 ratio it has the effect of making a companies reserves look bigger than they are on paper, leading to a higher valuation. The more conservative route would be to convert all reserves to their oil equivalent using the market prices of each commodity, which would result in a lower reserves figure.

Given its a very active space for acquisitions look up a few investor decks that explain the rationales behind the acquisitions. In most cases the acquirers lay out quite clearly how they think about the prices they've paid relative to the reserves they've acquired.

The future is uncertain. We have no clue whether oil&gas will be substituted by other energy source. It seems like the market is kinda confident that solar/wind is going to be the next thing, and it could happen in 5 years, or 25 years, or perhaps never. Therefore it's hard to find the terminal value of any commodity companies.

So what we can do realistically, without guessing the future, is to find companies that the return of investment is greater than their cost of capital, so that they create more value for us, until our premise, that O&G will remain relevant, changes."

You will see how much their oil reserves are. By doing this, you can project it yearly and do sensitivity analysis by using different prices then discount every dollar of cash inflow back to present value.

Buffett / Munger have been vocal publicly about a) how long it will take to transition to a clean energy source world and b) the alternative uses for fossil fuels particularly in the production of fertilizer.

If you look at the PV-10 for Occidental on page 131 of their 2023 report, you can see quite clearly how impacted the present value of those future cashflows are year to year, depending on the oil price used in their calculation. The 2022 total PV-10 is $58.15b vs the 2023 total PV-10 which is $40.3b as you mentioned.

So the price of oil is a major variable in their calculation. Also Buffett AFAIK made his investment in Occidental over a period of years and has a variety of instruments including warrants, so the blended market cap that he has invested in Occidental is most likely lower than the present market cap.

That'd be my guess anyway. Who knows 20 years from now what energy security is going to look like. Most of us have no first hand experience of the nationalization of ""strategically"" important assets. Property rights and the rule of law work right up until the moment they don't. Exxon for example has their reserves spread throughout the world.

It's not inconceivable to envision a world where one day you wake up to read a key oil field of theirs has opportunistically being nationalized. Just look at assets seized in the Russian / Ukraine war."

Basically this company will be broken up for parts and many creditors have long standing claims for reimbursement when the case finishes up. GRZ particularly, has assured shareholders of the potential to distribute a very large special dividend if receiving their arbitrary reward is successful. 

I will post my research below as I think this is a very interesting play. Any opinions or thoughts would be appreciated as I am still learning. One main concern for me since I don’t possess any legal expertise is the odds of GRZ actually obtaining their award in full(although I have tried to quantify it based on the amount of funds available by amount of creditors who’s claims would fit in the current valuation pool and discounted those odds of winning).

Here is my research attached, I hope it is concise and helpful any tips for future investing write ups would be appreciated.

460,Consumer Staple Names,2024-04-18 01:53:27,39.0,"Last night, I posted about an analysis I did of Vital Farms. I greatly appreciated the feedback, so I thought I'd try something similar here, and I hope to get a discussion going.

I believe the consumer staples sector could be undervalued. YTD, the XLP has returned 0.74%, vs. 2.69% for the Dow & 5.89% for the S&P. However, over the past five years, it's far outperformed the Dow while underperforming the S&P. 

I took a look at five names in particular in the XLP index:

1. Conagra (CAG)

2. General Mills (GIS)

3. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM)

4. Walgreens (WBA)

5. Walmart (WMT)

&#x200B;

Valuation: The winner here is ADM. CAG doesn't do badly on this front compared to the others. 

Growth: I looked at sales & EPS growth over the past five years. CAG wins on sales, with ADM in second. WMT wins on EPS, with ADM in second. 

**By the numbers:**

PE: CAG =14.77, GIS =15.19, ADM = 9.49, WBA = -2.55, WMT = 31.44

P/CF: CAG = 7.89, GIS = 11.87, ADM = 6.99, WBA = 15.87, WMT = 14.43

P/B: CAG = 1.53, GIS = 3.88, ADM = 1.30, WBA = 1.15, WMT = 5.78

PEG: CAG = 3.75, GIS = 3.77, ADM = 4.30, WBA = -1.76, WMT = 2.68

5-year Sales Growth: CAG = 9.11%, GIS = 5.01%, ADM = 7.86%, WBA = 1.12%, WMT = 4.73%

5-year EPS Growth: CAG = 0.65%, GIS = 9.47%, ADM = 15.44%, WBA?, WMT = 18.90%

&#x200B;

**My Takeaways from each company:**

CAG: Conagra is one of the largest frozen food companies in the United States, they have a relatively diverse portfolio of products, they seem relatively in-tune with consumer preferences, and they are in many stores. Walmart is their biggest customer, which in of itsself is a strong bull argument in my opinion. They are also a proven company, having been around for over a century. The bearish case, in my opinion, is Conagra competes with private labels as they increase in popularity. I have mixed feelings on this one overall. 

GIS: Like CAG, I believe General Mills will continue to face increased competition from private labels. However, they produce some iconic products such as Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Bisquick, and Betty Crocker that have name I.D. that doesn't really require advertising and with some consumers, they could be willing to spend more for these products. Additionally, their line of pet foods, specifically Blue Buffalo, is considered a premium brand. As a former pet owner myself, I know that many if not most who own a pet are more willing to spend more on their pet than they are on themselves. I'm moderately bullish on this name, though am weary of the private label competition. 

ADM: ADM is one of the largest commodity processing companies in the world, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. They have a proven business model and have generated income in the form of dividends for years as a dividend aristocrat. There are two major risks to the business, in my opinion. One, climate change is already disrupting the agricultural space and will continue to be a challenge to supply chains. Two, ADM is a leading producer of high fructose corn syrup which people like me avoid. This has become a relatively recent trend. I don't see a lot not to like here, I think it's a decent buy that is likely undervalued. 

WBA: I'm a little perplexed about the bearish sentiment around this company. The valuation is lousy. In their last earnings report in February, they reported $10.4b in debt, down from $14b a year ago. Their long-term debt also fell, from $9.7b to $8.4b. They have $70.7b in liabilities & $84.2b in assets. 2023 was a tough year for them, I get that. It just seems to me that they seem to be gradually turning things around and focusing on become a healthcare organization as opposed to just a retail organization (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/walgreens-ceo-says-companys-stores-boost-growing-health-care-business.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/walgreens-ceo-says-companys-stores-boost-growing-health-care-business.html)). I also think they are smart to move in a slightly new direction because they aren't going to win on pricing. They are also taking a bit of a gamble here: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/walgreens-ceo-says-human-interface-will-help-the-chain-beat-amazon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/walgreens-ceo-says-human-interface-will-help-the-chain-beat-amazon.html). 

WMT: As I've said before in other places here, I believe in the business model even though I don't personally like shopping there. Walmart has built a company that appeals to a majority of the U.S. population by establishing an expansive distribution network and focusing on volume instead of margins. Their inventory turnover is faster than the industry average and their main competitor, Target. They are dominant in the grocery space, and offer one-stop shopping. I also view their business as recession-proof. On the flip side, they are behind Amazon in terms of ecommerce. And they still rely heaving on China to import inexpensive consumer goods at a time when the world is focused on onshoring or friendshoring. Still, I'm very bullish on the name.

I am familiar with Village Supermarket, having lived most of my life in the northeast. 

Just looking at the numbers, it looks good. $968m in assets, $568m in liabilities, modest yet consistent revenue growth over the past few years, excellent EPS growth over the past five years, sales growth is better than Kroger & Albertson's actually over that same time period. I owe you a thank you, it's been a while since I looked at this one. 

As far as my personal view of the business, as I mentioned I lived in the northeast for almost my entire life until recently. In New Jersey, you really have four options for conventional grocery stores: Acme (owned by Albertsons), Stop & Shop, Foodtown, and Village owned Shop Rite. In my opinion, Shop Rite is the best of these. They have reasonable prices and a good private label.

“Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.”
“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”
“I always knew from when I was a little boy that the opportunities that were important that were going to come to me were few and that the trick was to prepare myself for seizing the few that came. This is not the attitude that they have at a big investment council. They think that if they study a million things, they can know a million things.”
“Just because you like it does not mean that the world will necessarily give it to you.”
“I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don’t have any real knowledge.”
“I always say I want to know where I would die so I can never go there.”
“The iron rule of nature is: You get what you reward for. If you want ants to come, you put sugar on the floor.”
“We’re just not interested in taking a substantial chance of taking a lot of very decent people back to “Go” so we can have one more zero on our net worth.”

I’ll stick to PAGS, but a similar picture can be painted for competitors like NASDAQ:STNE.   
PAGS is a 3.8B Brazilian fintech (incorporated in the Cayman Islands) that offers payment processing for e-commerce websites, mobile apps and terminals. Quarterly revenue growth is a steady 10% year over year with a net margin of \~10%. The industry was riding a wave of upward momentum.  
Pix is an instant payment platform created and managed by the Central Bank of Brazil, launched in Q4 2020. Pix costs 0.22% in transaction fees, while card fees start at 1%. Last year its usage rose to 42 billion payments, surpassing credit and debit card charges combined by about 23%.  
Two weeks ago, the central bank teased new features in a press release: automatic payment of recurring bills and payments in monthly instalments. The features are to be launched in October this year.  
This has all the ingredients to be a massive disruption of credit card processing revenue.  
Credit card sales contribute to total revenue of 34% PAGS and 49% STNE.

Ayai Tomisawa  
Wed, April 17, 2024 at 4:30 PM EDT  
  
(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is seeking the lowest premiums on yen bonds in more than two years as concern recedes in the credit market that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates again soon.  
  
The veteran investor’s firm is planning to sell multi-tranche bonds in the Japanese currency on Thursday. It’s likely to be one of the biggest yen deals by an overseas issuer since the BOJ scrapped the world’s last negative interest-rate regime last month.  
  
The deal serves as a key test of appetite for yen-denominated bonds, and is also being watched by equity-market investors amid speculation that Buffett may be preparing for another foray into Japanese stocks. His previous purchase of stakes in trading firms provided an endorsement of the nation’s shares that helped propel the Nikkei 225 to a record high.  
  
The extra yield on the deal is likely to be less than Berkshire’s bond sales over the past two years. For a three-year maturity, for example, final guidance showed a spread of 51 basis points over mid swaps, versus 59 basis points in November and 75 basis points in April 2023.  
  
Spreads on yen corporate bonds from both domestic and overseas issuers tightened to around 51 basis points on Wednesday, from around 66 basis points a year ago, according to a Bloomberg index.  
  
Buffett’s firm is a regular issuer of yen bonds, and has tapped the market twice a year in 2023 and 2022. Here’s a look at how much Berkshire paid on some maturities over the past two years:  
  
Note: Berkshire is marketing eight tranches of Reg S bonds in its latest deal, but some tenors may be dropped depending on investor demand.  
  
Buffett said in his annual letter in February that his Omaha-based firm has funded most of its investment in Japanese companies through yen bond offerings. Berkshire has said it hopes to eventually own 9.9% of each of the five major trading houses in which it’s invested.  
  
Its stakes in trading firms include 8.58% of Mitsubishi Corp., 7.47% of Itochu Corp. and 8.41% of Marubeni Corp., according to the latest information compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett’s equity picks in these companies have outperformed and any renewed backing may give a fresh boost to Japan stocks.","['key', 'For', 'ago', 'by', 'any', 'be', 'an', 'Reg', 'It', 'via', 'on', 'has', 'PM', 'Note', 'two', 'five', 'for', 'it', 'both', 'Bets']",,

I'm going down a bit of a rabbit hole here and made a post already today on a similar question. Basically Buffett claims you can tell if a company are faking profits if their net income is higher than what they reportedly pay in taxes.

To test this you take the Net Income Before Taxes and times is by the corporate tax rate (20%).

The Provisions for taxes - what Apple paid in taxes - does not equal $22.74B. Not even close. Assuming there are many apple shareholders here, have you done any research on this? Apple seem to pay about 15% of net income in Corporation Tax. Either that or they are lying about their income?

Income before taxes, per books, is calculated using generally accepted accounting principles as determined by the AICPA. It’s not how much taxes were paid - for that, refer to the statement of cash flows. Rather, it’s the amount of taxes that are expected to be paid, whether this year or in 10 years, that were accrued over the period. 

Taxable income follows fairly similar, but nonetheless independent rules set by the tax code. 

An example of a difference is depreciation. Accelerated depreciation under tax law is often higher than what is recorded on the book income statement. As a result, pre-tax income per books is higher than taxable income. 

The ratio you’re calculating, if compared to the 21% statutory rate, doesn’t consider tax credits either.

FYI, the corporate tax rate in the US is 21%. With average state corporate tax rates, you’re often looking at a combined federal and state rate around 26%."

No, this actually increases their US tax exposure because they're effectively moving foreign income to the US, where the value was created. Your articles are about how Apple minimized their *EU* taxes by taking advantage of a low tax system established by Ireland decades ago to lure foreign investment (which, incidentally, worked and which Ireland was very happy with). 

The system seems to be working exactly like it should with the taxes following the profits back to the US. The EU just seems angry that they're not getting the big corporate income taxes associated with the profits from creating the products and are instead stuck with some smaller income taxes associated with the EU's more limited role of retail and support."

Imagine a scenario where you can’t get US patent protection if you do an ownership inversion or subsequently sell US IP to a different jurisdiction. I don’t have the solution but collectively we can probably come up with an equitable approach."

The rest is being held offshore in the Jersey Island which has 0% taxes. 24B isn't their profit - it's just what they are remitting back to the US to cover R&D costs. Apple has minimal operations in the EU outside their retail stores. The offshoring of the remaining balance also means the US isn't collecting taxes on Apple.

Most of their foreign income never enters the US so has never been taxed. This is how offshore tax haven work.

Also, to be clear Apple isn't unique. Almost all US companies do this to avoid having to get taxed on income generated overseas."

583,I put together a 5 step checklist on how to fundamental analysis for a company (hope someone finds this useful),2024-04-17 10:46:31,47.0,"Here's a 5-step checklist on how to fundamental analysis for a company 

Hey, I put together a 5-step checklist for doing a fundamental analysis of a company using my 18+ years of experience in the stock markets.

I hope someone finds this useful. 

1. **Searching for New Investments**:
   - Use stock screeners to rank companies by growth or value metrics.
   - Read fund letters from professional money managers discussing investment ideas.
   - Review 13F filings to track investment moves by large funds.
   - Participate in investing forums to explore investment ideas and research.
   - Monitor insider buying through SEC Form 4 filings for potential investment leads.

2. **Analyzing the Company's Economic History**:
   - Study the company's annual report or 10-K for business understanding and history.
   - Identify the company’s primary revenue sources.
   - Evaluate historical performance using key financial metrics such as revenue growth, EBIT margins, cash flow yield, dividend yield, and return on capital.

3. **Assessing Competition**:
   - Compare the company’s growth, margins, and valuation to its peers.
   - Learn about the industry and the company's position within it.
   - Look for unique strategies or advantages the company might have over its competitors.

4. **Understanding Ownership and Management**:
   - Examine the company’s Proxy Statement and 10-K to see who the major shareholders and operators are.
   - Understand how management is incentivized to ensure alignment with shareholder interests.

5. **Making the Investment Decision**:
   - Decide whether the company fits your long-term investment criteria.
   - Do not feel compelled to invest due to time spent analyzing; be honest with your assessment.
   - Remember that the research process itself is valuable for your future investment analyses.

Simplistically, maybe the Company has $1B of debt senior to the converts and is deemed to be worth $500M and can only support $250M of debt - in this scenario, both the converts and the equity would likely be wiped (aka recover $0 on any $ invested)."

I think a good long term hold and dividend position for a young investor could be XOM or CVX in the energy space.

Please note that I am thinking more about you as a person than I am thinking about which stock is best.

You can learn a lot in a gigantic energy stock. You'll see how macro affects you. You'll see how geopolitics affects you.

AR will go up and down. It would be like being the worlds worst driver and hopping in a top fueler on a team with people that have never turned a wrench and driving down a bumpy dirt road. The likely result is disaster. Yeah you can learn stuff in AR too, but you can learn better with something that will give you a smoother ride.

1. Scale

So even other insurers choose to use their services. 

I'd also add brand. At least in the senior market, which is large and growing, I feel they have a better brand reputation than many of their competitors (not that they are perfect).

The bottom line is, it's complicated. All insurance companies negotiate the rates they will pay to each provider (hospital, clinic, etc). The bigger you are the more bargaining power you have. 

With United owned providers they have more leeway in setting those terms. That said, most of their ventures (Change Healthcare, Optum, etc) are ""payor agnostic"". That means UNH doesn't give itself preferential treatment vs their competitors. 

A simple benefit of owning the insurer and the doctor is that United gets to keep a larger portion of the total pie. Nationally hospital operating margins are 1-2%. Health insurance operating margins are 3.4% on average. But if you own both ends, you might earn \~4-6% on each dollar. 

Another important part of owning the providers is UNH can better control the quality of care. For example they can incentivize their doctors to conduct more preventative care which helps keep patient utilization lower overall. For example United will send a nurse to your home for a check up for free with most Medicare plans. They do this because it lowers overall costs by keeping people healthier."

Don’t buy dividend stocks or funds for this purpose. Stocks go down in price when dividends are paid so if the stock pays 7%, the share will go down by the same proportion.

670,Subaru - seems too cheap at a 4X PE ratio,2024-04-16 21:38:42,57.0,"Subaru Corp (7270, FUJHY) is the Japan based car company but over 80% of its sales come from the U.S., with the majority of those coming from selling three models - the Impreza, Forester, and Legacy.  

Mkt cap is about $17 billion, but it has $11.3 billion cash and $2.5 billion debt, so about $8.8 billion net cash.  

TTM operating income of $3 billion and TTM net income of $2.4 billion. Average operating income for past 8 years is about $2.4 billion.  
Seems to be trading at about 7X TTm earnings, but if we back out net cash, looks more like 3.5X earnings.  

I know automakers are struggling right now but a PE below 4 seems really low. The revenue has actually been growing quite nicely throughout 2023.   
  
From my read of US consumers and the product, there js a core demographic that seems to love Subaru and has pretty high brand loyalty to the Subaru brand, but a lot of people complain about engine problems and they are hard to maintain properly.    
  
Honda and Toyota have PE ratios of 10 and 11, respectively, and Ford and GM have PE ratios of 11 and 6, but GM has a distortion with its tax rate causing earnings to be higher than usual, and all of these other car companies have net debt, not net cash.   
  
EV/EBIT is 3.3, which is really low compared to its own history or Honda at 12.6, Toyota at 15.1, F at 32 ( 7.4 if we exclude debt of finance division), and Gm at 16.1.  
  
Subaru has experimented with buybacks for the first time ever in the last 12 months and clearly has the cash to do more but I think Japanese companies are just learning how to do these (fun fact buybacks were illegal in Japan until the early 2000s). Seems like it could be a catalyst to be revalued higher.

The claim was that these Japanese companies more specifically Toyota are sitting on the side lines letting other companies lose big money trying to get suppliers and infrastructure in place to make millions of EVs. The idea is that Toyota and others can then just jump in and start making EVs at mass scale, but importantly at a profit. 

It’ll be interesting to see, I’m not sure how it will play out. But they definitely won’t be growing much, ICE sales have been falling for almost a decade. And normally every EV sale is just one less ICE sale, they don’t often pull many customers from other brands.

Being such a large outlier while still meeting or even outperforming others in some areas is definitely getting me interested tho.

Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda has fought tooth and nail against his companies even making EVs, and wrongheadedly pushed for hydrogen cars, spending billions in a failed effort. It may have allowed BYD, Hyundai and Kia to get a foothold in key worldwide markets. This may be seen as a critical strategic mistake."

My read thus far is the U.S. politicians are pretty dedicated to blocking Chinese EVs. It’s the one thing Biden and Trump both agree on. Right now tariffs are 25% and probably going higher, and the Chinese EV companies are shipping elsewhere.  

The whole Japanese car industry, including Subaru and Toyota, has been late to the EV shift. What is a little dicey is that Subaru held out for a while and they have a kind of distinctive ICE engine - the boxer engine - but now want to make a radical shift to EVs. They want 400k EVs sold in U.S. by 2028 and 600k by 2030. I dunno if that’s possible, US appetite for EVs hasn’t been as high as people expected and Tesla is a formidable rival. This shift is probably gonna take a lot of capex and not clear the brand loyalty will extend to the EV versions of Impreza, Forester, and Legacy.  
  
On the plus side about half of Subaru’s production is already in the U.S. so can benefit from the U.S. EV subsidies to subsidize the capex a bit. The production in Japan should benefit from the weak yen."

You mentioned that a Japanese equity will have currency risk, but I actually question that for a company that has 80% of its sales in the U.S. The revenue is actually more tied to dollars than yen. The production split is about 60/40 Japan/US so there is more yen exposure on the expense side. So a yen depreciation is actually kind of a positive catalyst for earnings, which should ultimately determine the price. You can currency hedge with some brokers but I’m not sure it really matters when revenue is received in dollars.

>80% of its sales in the U.S.

However some key points:

1.  Revenue may go up but things like parts sourced externally also go up potentially?  Not sure the extent but small point to consider.

2.  It seems like they, along with many Japanese corporations, have an inexplicable desire to hoard cash.  If so, profits stored in cash could dramatically depreciate so it is a risk.  50%+ of their market value is stored in cash so you simply cannot ignore this risk without a hedge in my opinion.  To buy this company means to buy their cash pile.

3.  Promises of ""shareholder matters"" is nice but their buyback yield seems to be a paltry 1.6% of market cap.  Even at 30% of earnings, you are looking at 4.2% buyback + dividend yield.  Currently Ford has a dividend yield of 5.5%.  If they keep up their .33 dividend it will actually be far higher and all without currency risk.

4. I do not think PPP matters.  It has more to do with the impossibility of paying back their astronomical debt relative to GDP without printing new currency and yield curve control.  BoJ is slowly losing its grip and without harsh measures I really do not believe they can regain a stable currency.  Currently the Yen is the global piggybank for carry trades and I think that continues."

Now I’m convinced I do need to hedge, at least partially if not the full position. Interactive brokers gives a decent rate on yen borrowing, seems to be like about 1.5%, so could actually get a bit of carry as well. 
Could also go short yen futures I guess but it’s tough to size this correctly because of the fixed contract sizes.   
Yeah their language in shareholder friendliness is pretty weak. But they did just set this target for the capital returns, previously had only ever paid dividends. I think a lot of Japanese corporates are really just taking baby steps at this point towards shareholder return but it’s been slow steady progress, and I think within a few years the buyback could be quite sizable. My hope is more than the buyback yield itself, the steps toward shareholder friendliness cause a re-rating of the multiple.    
On 4) yeah seems like the large debt loads means BOJ will have to keel rates low and massive interest rate differential keeps funding the carry trade. I could see some scenarios where the yen strengthens, like maybe MOF intervenes, or maybe the carry trade unwinds a bit."

The screeners I use show their dividend has grown 9/10 of the past years. Always in total value, but the % fluctuated due to earnings spikes/troughs, and their debt to asset ratio is the low end of their sector.

&#x200B;

**Bullish case, in my view:**

\- In their Analyst Day Presentation last September, the company claimed that they have seen growth in same-store sales and that they entered into 8,000 new stores and 20 million new households. 

\-Organic food sales (in the country, not Vital Farms) have increased from $35 billion in 2013 to over $67 billion in 2023. Furthermore, growth is projected to continue to increase.

\-More and more consumers, in particular younger consumers, are interested in purchasing products from ethical companies that have regard for animals, human health, and the environment. Many (in at least one survey I saw, the vast majority) state they are willing to pay more for such products.

\-The consumer who is willing to spend more is more likely than not considered middle or upper income and therefore, economic downturns impact them less than someone on a very fixed income.

\-They work with smaller farms and therefore, are likely to able to negotiable mutually beneficial deals. While not a public company, Trader Joe's has thrived off this kind of situation. 

\-Personally, I am a fan of their eggs. I understand food is subjective. I have spoken with at least one other person who finds their eggs superior to the lower-priced eggs. 

**Bearish case, in my view:** 

\-While there are middle and upper income consumers who generally aren't as adversely impacted by economic downturns, there are still consumers in these income brackets who are. 

\-While the company claims to be the only one selling pasture-raised and ethical eggs nationally, that doesn't mean there won't be competition in the future.

\-Based on an internet search, they are available at a few Walmart stores in my area. People shop at Walmart for low prices. I think the company is smart to partner with Whole Foods, Target, and even some of the regional chains such as Publix, Safeway, and Shop Rite. I'm not so sure the Walmart partnership is the best idea. 

\-From a value perspective, the valuation is high, it's a young company, and they don't offer a dividend. 

&#x200B;

**My conclusion:** Personally, I believe in the business. On a personal level, I love that they are empowering family farms, are ethical, and offer an organic product. As I mentioned, I like their eggs. I have not had their other products. As for the stock, I am a bit conflicted; on the one hand, I generally like more established companies that pay dividends, the valuation metrics trouble me, and as I mentioned the Walmart partnership seems like it could be a mismatch. On the other hand, the company has seen decent growth and doesn't seem to be relying too much on debt relative to their shareholder equity. The stock is up 63.12% YTD; over the past five years, it'd down 28.62%. In October 2020, it was as high as $39.56. On a dip, it gets tempting.

Love their product, management team and their numbers.

They have a certain moat in their contracts/network with the pasture farmers, which offer good terms to the farmers and is difficult for a competitor to (quickly) establish (most farmers don't live up the standards that VITL and a would-be competitor would require, or they are taken by VITL already)

If there is additional regulation in future for the benefit of the hens then VITL is already well positioned.

They have a decent pricing power and customer loyalty due to their brand. Last year prices on eggs increased alot temporarily but they still increased their sales volume in that quarter, indicating that consumers still want eggs even when pricier and they didn’t then at least swap to (relatively) cheaper eggs during that period. This bodes well for future hikes on egg prices in general.

The risks as I see it is if a disease were to spread among egg farmers (similar to what we just saw recently, but seems this one was too minor to impact stock price) or if it is revealed that the living conditions of the hens isn’t what they claim (probably their biggest risk).

On each carton the name of the specific farm is written and on their website you can see (live) videos of the living conditions of each farm, which I think is great. I think this was done partly in response to some critics of the industry arguing that 'pasture raised' wasn't a definition decided by a government body (so far) and thus arguing that VITL was being 'dishonest' in their marketing when they used those terms (which I disagree with)."

It’s a quite simple/straightforward business which is great for a dummy like me :). People will continue to want their eggs."
801,Snap-On $SNA is announcing their results on Thursday tomorrow.,2024-04-17 10:46:11,63.0,"**This 100 year old automotive tools provider is announcing results tomorrow.**

Because their Q4 results (announced in Feb) showed a decline in the tools division, plus they don't give guidance, analysts are quite pessimistic on the Revenue and Earnings growth for 2024.

They are projecting 2.6% Revenue growth and only 1.6% EPS growth for 2024.

Currently they are being priced like they are only going to grow 2.3% in perpetuity  and not just 2024.

(2023 EPS of $18.76)  / ( Discount rate of 9% minus 2.3%) = $280  vs yesterdays price of $282.

**Which is kind of pessimistic because:**

a. in the past 10, 5 and 3 years, their EPS growth has been between 9-11% annualized.

b. Their Dividend is around 2.5% (and Dividend growth is about 14-15% a year), and share-buy back is around 1.5% a year.

I wouldn't want to bet against the analysts but if the results is adverse tomorrow, and the share price were to swoon, i may be tempted to nibble at the stock.

Cars in the US are getting older, from 8.5 years on average in 1996 to 10.5 years in 2010 to current 13 years in 2024. This means the long term outlook is positive, despite the business being cyclical.

How long do you plan to stay invested? What is your investment horizon?

How much time are you willing to commit to study and follow the companies you own? How much do you understand the companies you own?

How do you rate your risk tolerance and appetite?

There's like so much more context to consider before I can even attempt to answer this seemingly simple request.

An investor could be given the best portfolio in the world or try to clone the top investor but will end up underperforming. Not because the portfolio sucks or the investor sucks, but because they're not playing the same game. Not using the same strategy, approach and time horizon.

I just saw in a good quarter they make 50ct, so I figured 2$ EPS sounds reasonable.

Price was 12$ when I bought and I only sold because I found something else I liked even more. 

GEV turns profitable. They make money through service contracts, not sale of turbines. 75% of service revenue is secured for more than 10years. Of that, 50% for more than 15years. That is a high margin business. 
Also, grids get more complicated and need to be orchestrated, because it’s no longer just power plant -> grid -> household but way more variables that will have to give and deliver electricity to and from the grid. Furthermore the electricity will be way more volatile as there’ll be less base load from large (coal fired and nuclear) power plants. Hence their market leading software will grow and deliver ARR on a SaaS basis with the typical high margin of a software business. 
Again, good management. Big incentives through stock options.

Polski Koncern Naftovy Orlen - By far the biggest company in Poland measured in terms of revenue, and one of the largest in central and eastern europe. In the top 500 globally. 64,000 employees. The state has 49.9% ownership. 

**Okay, and what do they do?**

Refinining and distribution, mainly. The company products include aviation fuel, marine fuel, heating and technological fuels, petrochemical products, natural gas, asphalt, solvents and paraffins, oils, disinfection liquids, liquid gas, salt and related products. They also have an enormous network of gas stations throughout Eastern Europe, Germany, and Austria

**And what's so cool about their financials/valuation?**

These are actually mindblowing.

*Balance sheet*

- No debt of any significance, D/E = 0.15
- Long term assets are real tangible assets, intangibles are insignificant
- Current assets/liabilities heavily skewed to assets
- P/B: 0.48. For a company with virtually no leverage, that is truly extraordinary

*Income*

- Consistent profitability and strongly growing revenues. They have expanded considerably in recent years.
- Price/earnings = 3.3
- EV/EBIT = 2. You won't often see these multiples.

**Alright so what's the story?**

Currently in a total quagmire of shit, both politically and legally

- Under investigations for sanctions breaches with Russia/Iran. Not clear which. Possibly both
- The new government has accused them of cutting prices at the pump in an attempt to help the old government get re-elected. The prime minister has already fired the CEO and the matter is being investigated further
- Their Swiss trading company, Orlen trading, revealed they 'got scammed' out of $400m due to not properly verifying a new counterparty and subsequently not receiving their oil.
- The CEO of Orlen trading went to Poland last week to meet the new group CEO - and was promptly arrested in connection with the investigation into the missing $400m.
- A further, relatively minor issue is that they did not disclose this loss when they learned about it in late 2023, only earlier this month

Hear me out here - if the govt wants to nationalise, they would’ve to buy out Aramco at market valuation. If not, they run risk of running dry as Aramco supplies 45% of crude to refine. Aramco also holds strategic right to veto. Which means, we can expect them to act in their best interests.

""That is one of the mysteries of our business, and it is a mystery to me as well as to everybody else. We know from experience that eventually the market catches up with value. It realizes it in one way or another.""

Sometimes it's an acquisition, sometimes it's just people buying with no connection to each other, sometimes it's because some financial ""news"" company covered the business, sometimes it's because someone posted some solid DD on a forum. There's no way to predict when or why the price will catch up with the value. It typically does. I wish there was a less hand-wavy explanation, but that's all I have.

Keep in mind book values tend to be more than an asset would sell for."

(TLDR: i am sharing my google sheet of six small-cap companies that i shortlisted from a bigger list). 

I bought a tiny position in a small-cap company in Oct and it did very well for me. I was examining whether there are good bargains to be found in small-caps companies.

 

* Methodology, 
   * 1. Examine the list of companies held by ""Sidolti & Company"", which specializes in small and micro-cap investing. 
   * 2. Quickly Scan for ROE, ROA and ROIC first. ROE & ROIC should be in the teens, and there should be consistency over the last 10 years.  
   * 3. Based on the filtered list, do further quality checks based on,
      * FCF/Sales% (a proxy for margins, and an indicator that it is spitting free cash flow)
      * Debt / Equity 
      * Consistency of Revenue and Earnings Growth
   * 4. Finally, after filtering this, work out a the Buy-At price for these companies. 
   * 5. Put it in a watchlist and wait for the market to give me the price that i want. 

I have done up to 1-3. And I am sharing with you on the spreadsheet, There are NO analyst estimates, no valuation numbers. Just Data on these companies. 

From the 100 or so companies, i filtered out to 15 (step 2), and from there I shortlisted six companies. They are:

\- UFP Industries Inc UFPI  
\- Comfort Systems USA Inc FIX  
\- Simpson Manufacturing Co Inc SSD  
\- Barrett Business Services Inc BBSI  
\- AAON Inc AAON  
\- Federal Signal Corp FSS



Note:

\- these companies are in cyclical industries like building, industrial services etc 

\- UFPI is a fascinating company, i am doing a read-up on it, because i cannot believe a basic material company supplying wood can have such high margins and ROIC. 

\- BBSI almost didnt make the cut but i left it there because, the company is just turning around post-covid, and that is a major catalyst. 

Disclosure: i own a tracker stock in SSD, they make boring wood fasteners, but their company metrics is breathtaking.

Or you can go search for the holdings of your favorite investors on their website. Their quarterly letters should highlight their holdings. There are websites that specifically lists down the 13F holdings of money management firms. ( from Google: The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can provide insights into what the smart money is doing in the market.)

For me, the other lists I am have put as a todo is to look at the holdings of Terry Smith (Fund Smith) and Tweedy Browne.

I cannot get a definitive definition of the small/medium/large caps.

M* moved away from hard lines and they instead use relative definition, eg. bottom xx% of the market is small caps.

When I started investing during the time where policemen wore shorts, small cap was typically 300m, and mid cap was like 1bn  to 2bn or was it 3bn. And large cap was larger than 3 or 4bn.

Now, I find that the lines are like up to 2 or 4bn can still be a small cap, up to 10bn is a mid cap and > 12bn is the start of large cap.

This is playing havoc with my discount rate, where for the longest time, I used 15% for small caps, 12% for mid caps and 9% . But now it requires a bit of thinking , at the risk of being inconsistent.

880,"Turnaround Story : The North Face, Vans, Timberlands, Supreme. $VFC",2024-04-15 21:32:58,72.0,"## The Turnaround Story

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


&#x200B;

## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to grow their product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.

Go visit a few of their stores, talk to their floor staff, see if the inventory is fresh, marked down / on sale. Are customers in there shopping etc. Are floor staff numbers being cut as part of the cost savings / turnaround.

Get a feel for the business, beyond the numbers. Remember the business decisions drive the numbers, not the other way around.

The great thing about retailers is that the benefits of turnarounds are felt quickly as sales to customers are immediate. Contrast that to a manufacturing type business that might have multi year sales contracts, where a turnaround takes forever. With the right inventory and pricing, the turnaround may work quickly.

In terms of your comparative analysis, I'd offer a suggestion to focus on acquisition multiples rather than comparative market multiplies. Look for evidence / pricing signals as to what people have been willing to buy and sell clothing brands for, that'll be a far better proxy for ""intrinsic value"" than market multiples, which do not reflect the prices which business are bought and sold for.

The turnaround plan may be solid, but time is what they need. And if the refinancing of their debt at present interest rates gets away from them, they may not have enough time to see it through. Having said that, the large debt - equity discrepancy in their capitalization structure provides a lot of potential leverage to an investor.

If the turn around works, that leverage will provide a significant boost to your overall return. That aspect of it slightly reminds me of Munger's investment in Tenneco Automotive Inc.

Anyways next quarter you’ll see TNF grow quite a bit YoY, this is because of the late winter in Americas Region, pushing back sales to the next earnings, causing them to miss their latest quarter estimates. 

Vans revenue has slowed the past 3 years, I’ve been tracking their marketing efforts the past 5 months and can see in the recent month or so seeing many newer products and colorway.

Despite the cord cutting prevalent in the US and a focus on losing subscribers, Qurate is in fact a very international business with a significant presence in the UK/Germany that are quite stable.

Despite the apparent reliance on subscribers via cable tv, it is very much in fact an omni channel retailer

A core group of highly loyal customers are very stable and account for most of their sales. 20% of their customer base (which are much less correlated to cord cutting) account for 80% of sales

They lost some operational focus with poor acquisitions. The turnaround plan in place is rectifying this, having recently sold off Zulily allowing them to get back to refocus attention on their core customer

COVID was a nightmare for the company. They got a significant bump of what you might call ""tire kickers"" bored people at home who shopped once with them then left. This worked against their inventory planning / procurement resulting in them having the wrong merchandise for the wrong customers. It is taking them 1 - 2 years to refresh their stock, write down bad inventory investments and offer new stock that appeals to their core customer.

During COVID one of their main warehouse / distribution centers burned down. They have just received full insurance payout, but this severely disrupted deliveries, returns and customer service

Qurate is the out and out leader in tele retail holding something like 60% of the market.

They have a significant amount of debt in the business but it is very particular debt, guaranteed by a range of tracker stocks, commonly used by John Malone / Greg Maffei. The risk of default is less than what it appears on paper. 

The significant debt / market cap ratio provides a lot of leverage to an investor. Any restoration of profitability (which they are getting close to) will have the effect of catapulting the equity value. 

The market cap when I invested was $300-350m. On $10b of sales that's a 3% net profit margin. In the previous 10 years where it was profitable, the average net profit margin was 6.7%. So half of its historic profit margins will result in me having bought the business at effectively 1 times earnings.

There is a free kicker / opportunity to an investor that a much larger retailer might acquire the company. 

**Unknowns**

When assessing turnarounds the three things I look for is a) the person enacting the turnaround (i.e. the CEO) b) the articulation and clarity of the turnaround plan and c) the debt profile in place that provides the time needed for the turnaround to take place.

Answering that list in reverse, the debt profile as I mentioned is more stable and refinanceable than it appears at first glance. 

The turnaround plan itself ""Project Athens"" has what I look for, a clear articulation of the steps to be taken to return the business to profitability. You want to see a turnaround plan that says specifically here's where we are, here's what we are going to do, and here's the affect of those actions. Bonus points if numbers, targets and costs are included.

Lastly the newly appointed CEO David L. Rawlinson II, is the great unknown for me.

He is a trained lawyer who subsequently cut his corporate teeth in two different industries with jobs in Nielsen and Grainger. My hesitation is that a) the customer profile of Qurate are women, and b) both industries he's worked in, namely online data and tool distribution (principally used by men) do not overlap with Qurate's product range. 

The logic for his appointment is that as an omni channel retailer, his skillset in those two industries should transfer to Qurate irrespective of their core customers / products.

**Conclusion**

That last point, David L.Rawlinson, is what makes it speculative for me. I would have preferred a retailer with women's apparel / house goods experience or an insider to have gotten the top job. 

Because of this I scaled my investment down however, if the turnaround works, I'd expect the market cap to increase to perhaps $1b - $1.5b, which given my investment would return between 300% - 500%.

It could equally go nowhere, but I don't suspect it'll go bankrupt, so the downside is somewhat protected (with shareholder's equity in their latest accounts being $489m so consider that a backstop price).

As I said speculative and asymmetrical. Heads I don't lose much (or get out evens), tails I have a small multi bagger on my hands and all is right with the world."

I’m no ESG investor, but I was horrified. When the transfer fully settles, I will be liquidating the position. (I’m embarrassed to share all this, but I’ve a few tickers that I didn’t properly research back in 2021, because I’d trouble finding value and was in a transition period, myself.)

Boom and Bust 2024: Key Takeaways



China's Coal Expansion: Significant capacity additions are anticipated, driven by energy security concerns and economic stimulus. This expansion is poised to outpace retirements, leading to net capacity growth.



Global Coal Pipeline Shrinks: Outside of China, the pipeline for new coal projects has contracted substantially, reflecting heightened environmental concerns and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources.



Renewables Outpace Coal: Globally, operational coal plant capacity additions are dwarfed by new renewable energy installations, indicating a long-term trend towards decarbonization.



Financial Risks Escalate: Growing recognition of stranded asset risk and the superior economics of renewables are making coal financing increasingly challenging.



Policy Shifts Impact Investment: Government policies promoting clean energy and carbon reduction are further accelerating the decline of coal investments.

India's Coal Paradox: Despite expanding domestic coal production, India is witnessing a surge in renewable energy adoption, potentially impacting future coal demand.



OECD Coal Phase-out: OECD nations continue to lead the coal phase-out, with substantial capacity retirements expected, particularly in the United States and Europe.



Emerging Economies Diverge: While some emerging economies are scaling back coal expansion plans, others are still pursuing coal-based development, creating a complex and fragmented global landscape."

It is the value investor who will see the gyrations of the past week and yesterday and say to himself(or herself), if the market goes down tomorrow, what shall I start buying, how shall I start raising cash, how much to buy etc.

2. Mindset akin to private market investors, not influenced by short-term price movements.



3. Seek significant margins of safety to minimize capital loss risk.



4. Upside driven by improving earnings yields, not speculative appreciation.

I am no longer an investor in Paypal since the reason for buying it has changed for me. (Held it since ebay days till last year)

However, here is a bullish article written by someone more intelligent than me, i thought i would share it here even though i dont agree with the bullishness:



PayPal

PayPal has been a long-standing holding for Wedgewood, since 2015. After taking some of our gains around the company's COVID-19-fueled peak in 2021, we have been adding to the stock slowly over the past two years, taking it back to a significant position in the portfolio.

We would like to update you on our current thinking.

Like most ""COVID-19 stocks"", a variety of companies (e.g., Amazon) benefited from artificially high growth rates due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent stimulus; fundamentals at PayPal saw a normalization as the world returned to normal through 2021- 2022. Similar to most of those companies, many PayPal investors had incorrectly assumed their artificially elevated growth rates during the COVID-19 period would continue for years and were surprised when the normalization occurred, leading to a decline in the Company's admittedly overheated stock. The big difference between PayPal and many of these stocks (e.g., Amazon once again) is that PayPal still has not recovered from this broad normalization period.

When fundamentals at a previously loved company take a negative turn - as happened with many of the COVID-19 stocks when artificially high growth rates were normalized - we generally see investors tend to look past the obvious culprit and do their best to uncover other problems that may not be problems at all. In this case, it seemed that a few bears could see the culprit that seemed rather clear to us - namely, the very rational normalization in growth rates after a period of wildly inflated growth. Certainly, we observed this phenomenon around the post-COVID-19 normalization, when not just at PayPal but at almost all the COVID-19 beneficiaries experienced a sharp decline. The impact of this event in the significant downturn in technology stocks as the market adjusts to a new normal.

In PayPal's case, the winding down of the company's long-standing relationship with eBay also coincided with this period of normalization, contributing a bit more to the bust side of the boom/bust cycle everyone else was experiencing. The eBay situation had been coming for years, as anyone paying attention should have known - still, the timing of the final closure of the compounded the already negative PayPal stock sentiment.

Investors then began to propose a variety of additional theories about what was going wrong. Many of these theories can be categorized under the broad heading of ""share loss,"" where a variety of smaller payment platforms, digital wallets, ancillary service offerings all were (and still are) considered existential threats to PayPal.

Before the Federal Reserve's significant rate hiking program, the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) providers were one of the theoretical issues for PayPal, for example. Setting aside the questionable business case of borrowing money in order to lend it to consumers at zero percent - a business case that became even more questionable as the cost of borrowing rose significantly - there was plenty of noise around PayPal losing share to BNPL providers,""

Not the same as the ""risk free rate"", because the stock also has to beat inflation.

Seems to me the way to look at this is as follows:

Risky stock returning 10%, minus inflation of 2%, real return 8 %  
T Bill returning 0.5%, minus inflation of 2%, real return -1.5%  
Risk premium is 8%-(-1.5%) = 9.5%

Risky stock returning 10%, minus inflation of 3.5%, real return 6.5%  
T Bill returning 5%, minus inflation of 3.5%, real return 1.5%  
Risk premium is 6.5%-1.5% = 5%

Risk premiums have dropped significantly because the risk free rate has gone up.  

This is not a problem if rates go back to normal soon, but the longer they stay elevated, this hurts the value of stocks because the risk premium has decreased.

Isn't this right?"

The advantage is that I can see how they work in a country which they are not based on, the disadvantage is that I can't regularly visit American shops as much as I wanted. If you want me to compare both companies with their ""quality"", I prefer SBUX.
Nike has great products in America and it is a well known company but here, their products are garbage. I wanted to buy gym shoes last month (And I didn't care about the price). I did my research and tried so many shoes at local stores. Nike products don't have enough quality (I guess because of high inflation rates in here, they decided to send cheap Malaysia made ""things"" instead). I went to Hummel, Puma, Adidas, Skechers, Asics, Lotto and many more. 90% of these companies had better products. I bought Asics and decided to remove Nike from my buy-able shoe stores list. 
On the other hand, Starbucks has great quality and consistency between their stores located in America and other countries that I visited. If you know the name of the coffee that you like in a Starbucks, you can drink the exact same coffee in other countries/stores. That impresses me well. I drank coffee at so many different stores and brands, Starbucks in my top 10 list. If we exclude local ones, probably top 1.

How does the market cap of 7B indicate its strong presence in the US and Canada, the market cap is based on the stock market not its presence. 

A quick tool i liked in Peter Lynch’s book is multiply eps or FCF per share by your estimate of the company’s yearly growth and that is near the fair value. Not always right but can give you a bit of a guidepost. Doesnt work with companies that arent earning a lot or just began to earn income. With eps of 0.21 would take 300% yearly growth of the company to justify a share price in the 60s. Seems pretty overvalued to me at first glance unless they really boomed (not impossible of course).

**The Best Chinese Stocks to Buy**

These five undervalued Chinese stocks look attractive today.

Sbidag Demerjian

Apr 13, 2024

To say Chinese stocks have struggled lately is an understatement: The Morningstar China Index has lost nearly 17% annually during the past three years, while the Morningstar US Market Index has gained almost 8% annually during the same time period, as of April 10.

What happened?

Morningstar Indexes strategist Dan Lefkovitz explains:

“In the years following the 2007-09 financial crisis, China became the largest emerging market. By the end of 2020, Chinese internet companies Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY were among the 10 largest public companies globally. Then came a government crackdown, which saw leading companies’ market values slashed. At the macroeconomic level, China was widely anticipated to bounce back strongly in 2023 from “Zero Covid” lockdowns, but a property-market downturn and other woes undermined recovery.”

Long-term investors willing to accept the regulatory and geopolitical risks that come with investing in China will find many undervalued Chinese stocks of well-managed, competitively sound companies to choose from.

To come up with our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy now, we screened for:

+ Chinese companies whose stocks trade on a US exchange.

+ Chinese companies that earn wide Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings. We think companies with wide economic moats should remain competitive for 20 years or more.

+ Chinese stocks that are undervalued, as measured by our price/fair value metric.

**5 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy Now**

The stocks of these Chinese companies with wide economic moats are the most undervalued according to our metrics as of April 10, 2024.

* Tencent TCEHY
* Yum China YUMC
* Baidu BIDU
* [JD.com](http://JD.com) JD

* Alibaba BABA

Here’s a little more about each of the best Chinese stocks to buy, including commentary from the Morningstar analyst who covers the company. All data is as of April 10, 2024.

**Tencent**

* Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.44
* Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: High
* Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary
* Industry: Internet Content & Information

Tencent is the cheapest stock on our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy. The stock of this company from the content and information industry is trading 56% below our fair value estimate of $90. Management earns an exemplary capital allocation rating.

Over the past decade, Tencent has capitalized on the industry shift toward mobile gaming. The firm owns some of the world’s most popular titles, like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile. To date, games remain Tencent’s primary monetization model—as we estimate more than 40% of the group’s operating income comes from this segment. Tencent should continue to leverage its unrivaled access to user data and financial capital to create innovative, high-quality, and long-cycle games with a mobile-first approach.

Outside of games, other key businesses under the Tencent empire include WeChat, QQ, WePay, music streaming, on-demand cloud, and a host of other ventures. We see a tremendous amount of untapped value in WeChat, as it continues to increase monetization through advertising and acts as a major gateway for other internet services (payment, delivery, insurance, and so on) looking to access the 1.2 billion-plus WeChat users.

Given WeChat's huge and engaged user base, advertisers will continue to find it one of the top marketing channels. We think there are ample advertising revenue opportunities ahead, driven by 1) rising advertising inventory, 2) higher ad loads, and 3) improving ad-targeting efficiency.

While games and advertising will remain Tencent's core cash flow driver, we think the firm's investments in other areas (cloud storage, business services, enterprise software, and so on) also offer long-term value-creation potential. Given the size of China's economy and the prevalence of digital adoption, we surmise that there are enormous opportunities ahead for enterprise technology (think Zoom, Slack, and Teams), and Tencent will most likely turn these services into recurring revenue streams.

Tencent is also an investment powerhouse, and it loves using deals to expand its reach. Once invested, Tencent tends to add value through highlighting investees’ services on WeChat and other in-house traffic platforms—reducing customer acquisition costs while helping them scale rapidly. This strategy has paid off nicely, as external investments have generated an estimated internal rate of return of above 20% over the past decade.

**Yum China**

* Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.48

* Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium
* Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard Industry: Restaurants

Yum China operates in the restaurant industry and earns a standard rating for management’s capital allocation activities. Yum China stock is 52% undervalued; we think the stock is worth $80.

The covid-19 pandemic provided Yum China the opportunity to accelerate store openings at more favorable lease terms. The company added more than 3,700 locations from 2020 to 2022, equivalent to a 36% increase from 2019. Now that China’s zero-covid-19 policy is in the rearview mirror, we expect these new restaurants to not only deliver significant incremental revenue but also be accretive to the overall margins. Over the next several years, we expect Yum China to speed up new unit openings. We share management’s view that there remain plenty of expansion opportunities in lower-tier cities—evidenced by nearly 1,200 Chinese cities still with no KFC presence.

Over the longer term, we believe there are several opportunities for Yum China to gain a share in the fragmented, USD 700 billion Chinese restaurant market. In China, chains account for roughly 18% of restaurant spending, compared with 61% in the US and 34% across the globe. Our conviction in rising fast-food penetration is underpinned by three long-term secular trends: longer working hours for urban consumers; rapidly rising disposable income; and ever-smaller family sizes. Coupled with strong brand recognition and an unrivaled supply chain, Yum China is set to be the prime beneficiary of growing Chinese fast-food spending. We’re also optimistic about Yum China’s various top-line drivers, including value platforms, menu innovations, new restaurant formats, enhanced digital marketing efforts (underscored by 300 million loyalty program members), unrivaled delivery capabilities, and nascent brand expansion potential in Lavazza, Taco Bell, and Huang Ji Huang.

At its 2021 investor day, Yum China management committed a five-year budget of USD 1 billion-USD 1.5 billion to technology and digital development. We believe the company is beginning to reap the fruits of its investments. We believe a significant amount of cost savings will be passed through to the bottom line simply because these investments at scale are not likely to be replicated by competitors. This underpins our forecast for operating margin expansion over the long term.

**Baidu**



* Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.56 
* Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: High

* Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard
* Industry: Internet Content & Information

Baidu is 44% undervalued relative to our $183 fair value estimate. This top Chinese stock from the content and information industry earns a standard capital allocation rating.

Baidu’s online advertising business accounted for 73% of Core revenue in 2022 and will be the main source of revenue in the medium term given its dominant market share for search engines, but we believe unless it can develop another industry-leading business, it could face long-term challenges for advertising dollars from growing competitors such as Tencent and ByteDance. Baidu is increasingly shifting its focus toward its cloud business and now also artificial intelligence, with its Ernie generative AI model becoming its flagship product. We believe that Baidu is an early mover and should benefit from China’s AI development, but whether Ernie will be the long-term leader will depend on execution as we believe other resource-heavy companies have the potential to catch up to Baidu if there are missteps in its generative AI development.

While Baidu is transforming its identity by investing in generative AI, cloud, and autonomous driving, commercialized success remains to be seen. There are encouraging signs of its AI cloud monetization growing to 19% of core revenue in 2022 from 12% in 2020. However, despite sharp growth, we expect Baidu to face competition in the cloud from industry leaders Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent, which all have greater market share than Baidu. Despite a potential total addressable market for autonomous driving that is 9 times its online advertising per management, commercial success is highly uncertain as revenue remains immaterial, and mass scale adoption or time-to-market are unclear.

Its streaming video service, iQiyi, continues to be a margin drag on Baidu’s business due to a high content cost. The business constantly needs to develop or acquire new content to prevent customer churn. We’re less confident of its outlook than the Core product due to a low barrier to entry and numerous competitors. Membership has remained stagnant at 105 million to 106 million subscribers for the last five quarters, and therefore, we believe long-term growth is limited.

[**JD.com**](https://JD.com)

* Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.58

* Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: High
* Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary
* Industry: Internet Retail

This Chinese company operates in the internet retail industry. [JD.com](http://JD.com) stock trades 42% below our fair value estimate of $46. The company receives a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Exemplary for the quality of its balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions.

JD.com offers authentic products from its online first-party, or 1P, business with speedy and high-quality delivery service. It adopts an asset-heavy 1P model with self-owned inventory and largely self-built logistics, complemented by an asset-light third-party, or 3P, model. By comparison, its competitor Alibaba relies mostly on a 3P model. Underperforming Pinduoduo and Douyin, JD’s GMV/online retail sales of goods has decreased from 30.7% in 2021 to 29.2% in 2022. To reinvigorate growth, JD wants to change customers’ mindshare of JD as an everyday low-price platform and has launched a CNY 10 billion subsidy program to attract price-sensitive customers. It is removing sales of nonstrategic low-margin products from the 1P business and allowing 3P merchants and business partners to provide these products instead. JD.com is also streamlining its organization to increase its ability to respond to quickly changing market dynamics. We expect JD.com to see weaker sales growth this year amid these changes.

In the medium term, we expect to see stable margins, after cutting much of its unprofitable businesses such as community group purchase, Jingxi, and international businesses in 2022. [JD.com](http://JD.com) will continue to put more emphasis on high-quality profitability instead of low-quality growth. JD’s logistics business JDL became an independent business unit that opens its services to third parties. JDL management will be squarely focused on profitability as well and has achieved positive non-IFRS net profit in 2022. As the logistics business gains scale and reaches higher capacity utilization, we will see gross profit margin improvement.

JD is a long-term margin expansion story driven by increasing scale from its 1P and 3P businesses. Larger scale in each category will increase its bargaining power with suppliers. Since 2016, JD no longer fully reinvests its gains from improving scale and is committed to delivering annual margin expansion in the long run. The increase in mix from higher-margin third-party platform business and efficiency of scale will help lift margins.

**Alibaba**



* Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.79
* Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High
* Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard
* Industry: Internet Retail

Alibaba rounds out our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy. This stock looks 21% undervalued compared with our $94 fair value estimate. This internet retail company’s stock receives a standard capital allocation rating.

Alibaba is losing market share to PDD Holdings and Douyin in the China e-commerce business, and we don’t see a quick fix in the near term. Alibaba’s number of annual active consumers in the China retail marketplace was surpassed by PDD in the fiscal year ended March 2021. Meanwhile, Douyin has gained share from Alibaba especially in the beauty and apparel categories in recent years, and entered the traditional search-based e-commerce space, competing directly with Alibaba. The number of annual active consumers at Alibaba is close to the ceiling in China. Alibaba’s gross merchandise volume to China’s online retail sales of goods ratio was 62% in the year ended March 2023, down from 72% in the year-ago period. We believe Alibaba’s marketplace monetization rates will decline in the long run, due to mix-shift toward Taobao, which has lower take rate compared with Tmall, and more competition.

In our view, the Taobao/Tmall marketplaces remain as Alibaba's core cash flow driver and can support the expansion of AliCloud as well as the firm’s globalization strategy, which offers long-term growth potential. While AliCloud will remain in investment mode in the medium term, downsizing low-margin businesses can drive segment margins higher over time. On globalization, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group’s year-on-year revenue growth has been strong recently, thanks to AliExpress' expanding cross-border business.

We expect Alibaba to return more capital to shareholders and increase its return on invested capital after divestments of noncore investments. We are pleased that Alibaba has upsized its share-repurchase program by USD 25 billion for the next three fiscal years (until end-March 2027) to USD 35.3 billion. Management targets to lift ROIC (based on Alibaba’s calculation) from single digits in fiscal 2023 to double digits in the next few years. Alibaba had sizable cash and equivalents and investments of CNY 829 billion on its balance sheet as of December 2023.

The same goes for Pfizer. Both are a longer term play that will take a few years to develop, but everything in both their pipelines are going to be a massive boon to revenue. In a market that's so forward looking that it's taking things into consideration that are several years down the line, they sure as shit can't see further than 2 years for a lot of the unfavored companies right now. That's where you have the best opportunity. But don't throw all your eggs into one basket if you're just starting out. Also, look at Google and Meta. 

-Intel is massively undervalued right now for everything that's coming in the next few years, so much that I bought another 200 shares on Thursday and Friday, and im prepared to buy more if it dips further. As long as you're holding long term, definitely start there. IMO, Intel is likely to 3x in the next 5 years, if not more. Intel is investing 100 billion into creating the world's largest semiconductor plant and converting about a third of the business to an external foundry. The foundry buildout alone is expected to bring in as much as 30 billion in revenue annually by 2030, and it'll snowball from there as they build more fabs. Intel also developed cutting edge nodes with first to market backside power delivery and GAAFET, which TSMC and Samsung won't catch up on for about 2 years, give or take. Gelsingers turnaround of the company has been nothing less than amazing. Intel was literally dying from stagnation before he stepped in. Now, it's going back to innovation, which is what made Intel so dominant back in the day.

-Pfizer is down in the dumps purely because the Covid vaccine necessity disappeared as world governments FINALLY stopped creating mass hysteria. The Covid hysteria is unlikely to return, which is why it's at a 10 year low. However, excluding the Covid vaccine, their sales were still up almost 10%. They signaled a decline next year, but even now the stock is at a low 11 forward PE. Their recent Seagen acquisition will be a massive boon, and that's why I say the stock is very much undervalued. The combined chemo drugs in both companies pipelines, along with combining their research will lead to Pfizer cornering the market on next gen chemotherapy drugs. And you'll get paid one of the highest dividends on the market for holding it.

-Google is lagging behind in the AI game, but it's catching up, and the stock price is still very modest for a company that's integrated with our daily lives and with massive potential in AI. The only reason why it's not higher is because a lot of people believe that they'll always be behind due to the garbage CEO. I think they're wrong, at least about the always behind part. What they say about the CEO is accurate IMO.

-Meta is undervalued even now, but it certainly isn't a ""value"" anymore like it was back in the sub $350 range. Still a great company that's likely to do a stock split soon. They're heavy into the AI game, developing their own AI accelerator, and have massive ad revenue. If the ""Metaverse"" takes off, will have another huge source of ad revenue. Think ""Ready Player One"".

One last thing... Do your own research. Don't take someone's word for it, especially on Reddit. I gave you a few prospects, but you should do your own analysis before buying. Some people will try to pump stocks on these forums so they can sell when it goes up."

HSBC- They’re downsizing operations and gives you China exposure. If all works out they’ll have a bigger U.S. presence as well. Book value under 1 and has a bigger dividend than Citi. 

CMCSA- Could be a value trap, but they have growing revenue and EBITDA. FCF is also huge as well, so why not.

SBUX - if they can figure s**t out they are in store for a huge comeback

CVS - a bumpy road may be ahead but the future is bright for healthcare. They are positioned to go along for the ride. It might be long play though. 

JNJ - long term what’s not to like here. Again, healthcare is ready to move with an aging population.

FTS - it’s been stagnant too long and once rates start coming down investors will flock to the safe steady grower. Might take a few years for this one to play out. 

TD - another steady grower hurt by high interest rates. 

SJM - this is one really depends on how well they can integrate Hostess and provide better brand recognition. 

MOV - this is my most speculative and I admit it could be a value trap. That being said, I love their product design and it seems they are just ready to fly.

Step 1) I start by coming up with a basic set of investing goals that I want to achieve and a timeframe in which I expect to achieve those goals. It's very important to be realistic in this stage, as setting an unrealistic goal will set me up for failure.

Step 2) I try my best to identify my circle of competency, my strengths as an investor and my weaknesses. To me, it doesn't make sense to own a company that I don't understand. In my particular case, this means I gravitate towards retail and industrial companies.

I'm sure there are plenty of perfectly great bio-tech firms out there, but I have no idea how any of those businesses operate, so I steer clear.

3) Once I have a goal and a broad idea of what investments I can use to meet that goal, I begin screening. I use a variety of sites/tools, but a really great one anybody can use for free is Tradingview. It has just about every single valuation multiple and metric that you could think of and a nice interface.

4) Once I have a short-list of tickers, I quickly read through their financial statements for the last five years and look at a few other metrics. It's typical to reject a few tickers here.

5) Once I have an even shorter list, usually only about 3-6 tickers at this point, I start reading the latest annual reports of those respective companies to get a sense of how they operate and what's driving their finances. A few more companies get rejected here.

6)Once I've narrowed it down to 2-3 companies the valuation process begins. I may elect to do a simple single-page DCF or CCA if I'm skeptical about the investment and don't want to waste any more time. But more often than not I make a 3-statement model in excel and use those projections for valuation. 

Sometimes I go this far and I still don't buy the stock and go back to step 1.

That's just a rough overview of how I do it. If you want to learn a lot more, check out the resources in the sidebar. Particularly, Aswath Damodaran's website and youtube. He's the real deal and wants to help others learn."

But I find it takes time to do this research. 10k's and 10q's take time to read. Then you still need to do some sort of valuation to determine that the investment offers some value. Also, in the process of doing this, I'll typically reject most investments for one reason or another causing this process to become even more time-consuming.

It can take me 30 hours of work from initial screening to clicking the buy button.

Also, don't bother trusting anyone else's picks, the financial media, influencers or social media. Everyone has an agenda and none of them, except yours, involve you getting rich."

GEV makes money through service contracts, not through the sale of gas and wind turbines. Their revenue is increasing, and secured for more than 10 years. Strong FCF. 

Grids get more difficult to manage. They have the best software to orchestrate many different players on the grid. They will have ARR from software, so SaaS. 

They are debt free!

Management is highly incentivized through stock options and performance stocks. CEO for example 1,2mio base salary and 4mio in stock.

The truth that markets are telling you is that the cost of mining is rising. Last year, I have an ex-client tell me that cost of hiring a gold miner in Australia was AUD 1mn a year. I was incredulous, until he explained that you needed two employees at an Australian mine to make the equivalent of a one full time employee. You then needed to add in accommodation, food, health, and insurance for these two workers, on top of AUD 250,000 salary, and you got to AUD 1m a year. Taking current gold price, and Australian dollar exchange rate, this one worker equivalent needs to mine 300 ounces of gold (3/4 of a gold bar). This is 8500 grams of gold. A high quality mine will have 10 grams of gold per tonne of ore, which basically mean 850 tonnes of ore will need to be mined, or bit more than 2 tonnes a day, to find 20 grams of gold (I am not a gold mining specialist, but these numbers seem about right to me - please contact me if I am wrong)."

They agree to a value of gold by virtue of tradition but bitcoin(which I have absolutely no faith in) has gone to prove that there can be a value ascribed to computation so as the world continues to evolve with the divide getting greater still I don't think that volatility in price of gold is going away at all, it is all a matter of where the herds are rushing off to, what as civilizations we put value into...

I read about Crocs a multiple times now in this sub and after looking in my drawer and finding 5 pairs of these foam shoes, I decided to do an anylsis myself. And what can I say, I am amazed.

Please check the Analysis attached in total and tell me what you think. But here is the **TL;DR** in the meantime:

**Pros**

* Best margins among pears (EBITDA ca. 25%)
   * The only companies that come close are luxury apparel manufacturers like LVMH
* Strong revenue growth
   * double digits in the last 5 years
* Great management
   * Experienced directors who constantly reach their goals
   * They managed to shift the image from ugly shoes to trending fashion pieces
   * They [collaborate](https://www.crocs.com/collaborations.html) with a ton of celebrities and fashion brands
   * Additionally, they were using the cashflows to either invest, buy back shares or pay off debt (reached their target capital structure already)

**Cons**

* Much of their growth is due to trends, which can be risky if they dont sustain those trends
* Although functional shoes seem stable, their shift to trend products might make them cyclical
* The stock already caught up on much of the value, although the stock still looks cheap
* The HEYDUDE acquisiton in 2022 was very expensive and financed by a lot of debt
   * This messed up the groups balance sheet and forced them to pay off debt instead of buying back shares when the stock was cheap
   * Also, HEYDUDE has yet to perform to justify the high price

I see a world in which CROX pays off all its debt and just distributes all its FCF as a dividend as it has no growth prospects and permanently have a single digit PE. Yes, China is a growth lever but it's such a small % of sales and HD is just disappointing. 70-80% of acquisitions are failures and HD is no different. If they ever sell off HD to recoup maybe even 1B and funnel it towards deleveraging + share buybacks, I'll definitely hop back in. But as a growth story, CROX is finished.

For the past few weeks, I have been studying Lockheed Martin as a potential investment. The main reason is that the valuation seems to be relatively modest (PE \~16x), despite all of the following:

\-  Great fundamentals (high Return on Capital, high turnover and margins, high but sustainable debt),

\-  A good shareholder remuneration with growing dividends and decreasing share count,

\- Significant barriers to entry due to proprietary technology, intangible assets, switching costs from its products, huge capital investments required to enter the business,

I have gathered my thoughts in the following post:

That is more or less the approach I am planning to take and the question I have right now with LMT.

They do raise prices significantly, but since these parts small portion of the overall cost of the aircraft, customers don't mind paying for them. Plus, they put in significant effort to ensure parts are readily available to customers who don't want to keep their aircraft grounded for long as this also costs them money. But ya, when they are in a position like they are now, government regulation is something investors need to keep an eye on."

That would be my main concern with TDG and how much debt they carry which is $21 billion. But given that TDG is often the sole supplier for certain aerospace parts, they have significant pricing power to make up for it. And given that these parts make up a small percentage of the overall aircraft's cost, customers tend to pay up for these parts. So to answer your question, I believe that they still have untapped pricing power for numerous components and there still should be numerous businesses they can acquire."

And here I thought that LMT's debt (\~2x Operating Cash Flow, FY 2023)) was already quite high, but I now see that TransDigm has has debt over 10x Operating Cash Flow (FY 2023). Interest expense eats around 50% of the EBIT, so I wonder how this will keep impacting TransDigm if interest rates remain high for longer than expected."

But based on recent share price performance of TDG, investors don't care for now..."
