** accidental graphic is from the link from adidas ceo saying that China was recovering.. 

Regarding Nike, today’s news wasn’t unexpected as the warnings (Sam Poser from Williams Trading) came as early as last week that the company was gonna miss. 

Actually the numbers wasn’t so bad, sales was flat and earning beat, that US and China sales were up was unexpected (Europe and Converse were down),  and it caused an initial bump up of the share price.

But the share price dropped 5-6% AH when the company forecasted that fy2025 was going to be soft in the first half and sales was going to decline by single digit in 1H and only pick up only in 2nd half of fy2025. 

Well it sounds terrible until you realise that Nike’s financial year is from June to May, which means that the calendar year 2024 is a Zzzz year while they try and fix the problem.

I will probably sit tight with my 0.5% portfolio of Nke and buy some more after the swoon.

I see a couple of catalysts here:

- Paris Olympics. 
- Continued business recovery in China. ( adidas ceo [commented](https://www.ft.com/content/d1bf3d32-176f-4110-a04d-4448268d1946) last week he was bullish on China) 

Regarding Lulu, they fell 10% AH due to guidance. The difference between the two is that Nike has been falling all of last year while the inverse is true for Lulu.

I will do some DD on Lulu later today, I want to be convinced that Lulu isn’t a fad and more of a lifestyle choice like Nike. 

TLDR: if you don’t buy high quality companies when they are cheap, then when do you buy them? Our job, as value investors is to check and see if the problem is temporary or a permanent impairment of the business.

I have felt like we are in a soft landing for awhile now and this further supports it, I follow a bunch of industrial and retail companies and guidance is flat across the board, the exception has been certain retailers that offer needs as opposed to wants. 

I don't like Lulu and I am glad they're down and I hope they go down more, it's a personal opinion based thing and don't expect anyone to agree, if more people were like me the company wouldn't exist but that's obviously not the case. They sell fabrics for giant markups made by impoverished people in poor living situations, yet it's consumers are convinced it's a symbol of status and will tell you it's because they're comfortable and great quality which is true but not the main reason it's purchased. You can buy equivalents from Costco for a fraction of the price that are equally as comfortable and durable, still made by cheap labour though. I could get behind paying $100-200 for pants if I know the quality is good and it took someone 2-4 hours to put together, but not an impoverished person in Asia pumping out dozens per hour, for that I'd pay far less (I never said I'm a good person). Chip Wilson said consumer spending habits are changing, the demographic that buys their clothing is more pinched by raising rates and is typically more indebted, these groups are probably coming to the realization that more pricey brand names aren't great for your pocket. Same dude has one of the largest impacts in my city for the cost of living crisis, I got lucky and got in early but he owns 5000 or so units in my city where the average detached home is 3m (2.2m USD), helping screw over most future generations."

I'm not sure if they ever officially came out and said. I think at a certain point, they just stopped mentioning it. They said they estimated it would cost them $10B in revenue in 2022 (then never updated that number). They mentioned targeting and conversions would be an issue. Conversion they hoped to address quickly and targeting would take a few years. From what I can gather, they just learned to do more with less data. Their Cost of Revenue went from \~18% in 2020, to 19% in 2021 (partial ios impact), to 22% in 2022 (full ios impact), back down to 19% in 2023.

They're also finding ways to get around GDPR by offering European users the choice between a subscription service (w no ads or tracking) or an ads based service (with tracking). Im guessing Europe will find some way to sue over that. (They always do)  
\>I know the other major reason the stock turned around was because Zuck listened to investors and cut spending on the metaverse, but I’m more interested in how they got around this tracking issue.

This is not true. Perhaps on an absolute basis, metaverse spending was cut, just because they laid off 20,000 people. But on a relative basis, they are still spending a shit ton on the Metaverse. 

It's super important to NOT get your news from Reddit. Reddit is just a collection of headlines, and then a comment section filled with people who didn't even read the article. It's a fun waste of time, but little else."

* and a surge in negative public perception centered around Zuckerberg.  
* Panic selling. 

My thesis is they could have sat tight and the stock would have recovered with no extraordinary actions. They just make that much money.  It would have taken longer and I do not believe we'd have seen 500.

But YES. Meta DID re-engineer their tracking methodology and were able to track user behavior without the need of apple.

There was a blip once the blocking was implemented but they have billions of $ to implement a new tech ( i worked with marketing and saw new products being released by meta during the period which showed significant growth)

And follow that with Metaverse. Metaverse was and IS still happening and if one had just looked at how they were deploying cash back then ( all money was going into infrastructure development) it was clear that the public had no fuckin idea how tech esp AI worked

For AI ( of anykind) to work- hardware is most important- and Meta started that game earlier than most

From what I understand, the only thing the 'Do Not Track' button does is that it stops your device from sharing the identifier for advertisers (IDFA) which is a unique serial number attached to each device that can be used to track user activity across different apps. But, apps can still collect lots of other information: your IP address, your device specs, your location etc. which is enough to create a unique blueprint for any user. This is supposedly against Apple's ToS but their enforcement is lax. So ultimately, I think the feature is just privacy theater and doesn't meaningfully affect the data these apps can collect.

From a technical perspective, I am a software engineer (not mobile btw) there are ways to track users let's say ""server side"" (eg. User + Device fingerprinting, etc.). Perhaps they are tracking users behavior in this way rather than iPhone side, also by using agreements with other data collecting companies.

I would also add to the previous comment that I read once that it appears that only 30% dont allow tracking.. 

My girlfriend and dad both allowed Meta tracking them on their iOS devices when I  checked.. they didn't even know they allowed and barely know what tracking is.

Meta also said something about investing heavily in AI to deliver more relevant ads with less data.

Its hard to say what they actually turned around or what just became new growth. They stagnated for 1,5 years or so, but so did other companies. Then they grew insanely fast last quarter out of nowhere..

Who knows without the 30% of iOS users opting out of tracking they would have grown even more. Or the online ad market just grew a lot? 

The thing also is, online advertisers didnt really have another platform to go to anyway. So they kinda have to pay Meta anyway.. Meta has a serious monopoly because millions of people can't be targeted anywhere else than TV or through Meta apps ads. 

And as last, when Meta did stagnate in revenue (at the same time Apple updated that iOS), companies were also in general afraid for a recession and used less on marketing, so it looked like it was really hitting them more than it did i think."

It outperforms the benchmarks and has a great growth outlook, yet it trades at a cheap valuation and significant discount to Airbnb. 

I mean, this company is projected to grow its top line by high single digits and EPS by over 15% for the foreseeable future, yet it trades at just 20x earnings. For perspective, Airbnb, which has a similar growth outlook, is valued at over 30x earnings for both this year and the next fiscal year and trades at a PEG of 2.5. This is far ahead of Booking’s discounted PEG of 1.12, which is just ridiculous and a 27% discount to the sector median.

The only real reasons for this are a perceived weak moat and economic sensitivity, but the company has proven over decades that it is well able to grow through cycles and has so far proven well able to maintain customers, even in the face of significant competition. 

On top of this, the company is one of the best in terms of returning cash to shareholders, lowering the share count by 9% in 2023 alone. It has now also introduced a dividend, making it one of the most compelling dividend growth stocks out there.

Eps/revenue etc. are all predetermined numbers. They aren't real. Fake to please the lot who called investor relations. 

Booking.com for now is a solid firm; but it's supply pool (hotels) is seeing their margins (net profit margin decline) due to a fucked up housing market worldwide with shit like Airbnb etc. 

So brick and mortar 

- like hotels on booking.com will become more expensive because environmental reasons will press margins, competitors

- booking.com has the advantage of a wide supply pool worldwide so if a economy in the west doesn't do well in the east it might not. 

Bottom line they earn.

But they are a extremely vanilla business that just came right time right place. 

Hotels will seek and invent more (interactive daughters chains) - like f1 simulators close to a track. They won't book this through booking.com because the supply pool who goes there picks the cheaper solutions.

* Hotels will innovate and sell packages through events
* Firms like Airbnb will get more and more struggling issues due to the issue of people. 30yrs still living at home

Both are at booking.com

Booking.com will slim down and simply use the shit cheap west to east (known) for it's hostels and 1-2-3 hotels so trigonometry wise it will keep earning money but it's net profit margin (how much profit after tax % out of 1€ revenue will decline (but not become negative)).

This is a firm on its decline. One to stay with us; but the big bucket with cash and earning (more) than expected will never happen again.

Therefore filtering on ""metrics"" is silly.

Think. 

If you adjust the metrics for this info you get a ""fair valuation"". While now it deceives to look cheap. 

It isn't.

It will only become interesting if they vertically innovate their cashflow. Like they help (customer - airline - taxi) = sum costs to decline by providig tailored insurances for examples."

Does it make any sense to buy an ETF as a value investor?  
  
Here is my reasoning for this: 

What is value investing? Buying a company at fair price or below, act like an owner and not a trader, and know what you own. This means being in a position to know what the company is worth, by estimating its future cash flow from now to judgment day. How do you value a company? There are quantitative measures, of course, like p/e, p/fcf, etc, which are readily available for ETFs, too. However the qualitative aspect is also pivotal. I list some principles inspired by Munger and Buffett:  


1. To invest you need to know and trust that the management has integrity and that their incentives are aligned with yours.

2. To invest you have to stay in your circle of competence, to be able to assess the business fundamentals of the company, its moat, and endurance. That means not investing in sectors you have no clue about, or in companies whose product you can barely decipher.

3. Value is not price. Mr Market is a lunatic and he should serve us, not the other way around. In particular, risk is not a function of volatility. In fact, if something drops in price ceteris paribus it is less risky, despite beta being higher. 

4. Only one kind of information should guide our investment decisions: what is relevant and knowable. Macro is not knowable, so we should largely ignore it.  
  
Now, looking at all these principles, if you are a value investor how does it make sense sense to invest in an etf, especially the most popular ones which are (a) broadly diversified and (b) market weighted? For:  


*  You can't trust the management of the companies you own, because ETFs have hundreds of companies in them, how can you possibly do due diligence on the management of each of them?

* If the ETF is broadly diversified, it invests in sectors you have no clue about, so you are not staying in your circle of competence.

* Most ETFs are based on what the market thinks: they are market cap weighted (b). Which means that, by definition, they just follow what Mr market thinks of a sector/company. VT is 64% US equities, for example.

* If a company drops a lot for no reason, if the ETF is market cap weighted (b), the company's weight is diminished, not boosted. If it rises beyond any reasonable expectation, the ETF will follow. A year ago Nvidia was 1.8& of the S&P, now it is over 5%. 

* This is more controversial, but I feel that if you invest in a sector or in a broadly diversified index, the variables that matter most of all are all macro-economic ones: interest rates, fed-policies, politics, macro-economic trends etc. So the result of the investment is relying on information you cannot predict.

Conclusion: ETFs don't make any sense, from a value-investing perspective. They might make sense from another perspective, but not from a value-investing one.","['or', 'cash', 'fcf', 'You', 'do', 'kind', 'he', 'ago', 'be', 'Now', 'it', 'an', 'for', 'by', 'For', 'now', 'lot', 'act', 'me', 'any', 'has', 'way', 'So', 'on', 'all', 'are', 'can', 'you', 'so']",,

but even there youre kinda wrong since i could own ETFs like VTI and BND and then use like 10% of my money to actively trade and that would be 100% within grahams wisdom as well.

youre far too concerned with market cap weighting. you can buy non weighted versions of most weighted passive ETFs but they tend to under perform the market cap weighted ones. also warren buffet has long said the average person should just DCA into an index. those indexes are market cap weighted by and large.

so no i dont think ETFs are incompatible with value investing. i think actively trading is incompatible with making money for the vast majority of people who try it and even most of those who do make money would have made more and saved a lot of time and effort had they bought an ETF like VOO or VTI and just done something else with their time."

205,One thing no one seems to mention about Warren...he's a savant. Possibly an autistic savant.,2024-03-20 18:40:45,12.0,"This post isn't about an investing prospect, but about the man who's been the #1 investing teacher to all of us, Warren E. Buffett. I've watched a lot of his interviews and annual shareholder meetings. He's endlessly personable, folksy, and charismatic. That's why he draws such huge crowds. 

I've also read the Lowenstein biography, and right now I'm 300 pages into the Alice Schroeder biography. And at that point in the biography, Warren's just about 35....Alice spends a lot of time on his early years, much more than Roger Lowenstein did. 

And the Warren in those books is a little different than the Warren we see on stage. The first thing that jumps out at you is his IQ. The Warren we see on stage is really smart. The Warren in the biographies is really, really, REALLY smart. On stage, he constantly downplays his mental abilities. But exaggerated modesty is part of his schtick, and his charm. 

And Warren is not just really smart, smart, if that makes sense. It's more than that. It's never labeled explicitly in the books, but it's clear that Warren has savant syndrome. He might even be classified as an autistic savant, though that's harder to diagnose.

His mathematical ability is the first thing that obviously stands out. Warren says he's never owned a calculator, because he doesn't need one. He can manipulate large numbers in his head in just seconds, or faster. And by manipulate, it's not multiplication and division, but fairly complicated formulas like a CAGR return. 

I've only found one video of him doing this in person, and it's a comparatively minor feat (though still impressive), and here it is:

[https://youtu.be/mmcasm-sG0Y?t=330](https://youtu.be/mmcasm-sG0Y?t=330)

Just his ability to perform calculations in his head already puts him in the savant realm. Normal humans can't do that stuff. But his abilities go beyond that. 

Again the books never label this, but they give examples of an eidetic memory. For instance, in HS and college, Warren just read all the books he felt he needed to read before the year started, and he was apparently done studying for the year. From then on, he could recall their contents from memory, and would show off by correcting his teachers if they misquoted a textbook.  

His memory for numbers, in particular, is even more impressive, and again can only be described as superhuman. There are multiple accounts of his ability to consume absolutely massive amounts of numbers and recall any particular one instantly. He'd read though thousands and thousands of pages of the Moody's manuals and if you named a company from those pages and asked for the basic financials, he could recite them to you right away. 

The last bit of evidence to mention, and it's amazing the biographies didn't harp on this a little more, was his precociousness. Warren was a prodigy. He was reading college-level investing books when he was 7. Seven. Most kids at that age can't even read a book, any book. 

One thing that's interesting to note, or at least interesting to me, is that as I've made my way through these biographies, I do see a lot of parallels between Warren and another popular fictional genius. And that's the Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper. In fact, that's how I've been describing Warren to friends and family who don't follow him like I do. ""He's Sheldon Cooper, but single-mindedly obsessed with business instead of physics.""

Some of the parallels: they have, I think, about the same IQ. There's the eidetic memory, of course. They both love trains and doing their own taxes, although Sheldon started that even earlier than Warren (6 vs.14). They both love their routines and repetition. They both need taken care of outside of their work. (Both biographies say that, for Susie, being married to Warren is like having another child to take care of.) And they have an at-time rude self-centeredness, a focus on what they see as ""theirs"". 

There are a number of examples of this in the biographies, but one of the most extreme ones would be Warren's train set. When he's in his 30s, one of Warren's investors builds him an enormous, amazing train set in the attic of his Farnam street house. Warren's children are at the perfect ages to delighted and captivated by this train set, which was something Warren always wanted as a child. But the train set is HIS, and *the children aren't allowed near it.*

That's about it for this post. My point in writing it is to say that, for all we talk about Warren, you never hear discussed just how truly, mind-blowingly intelligent he is. And he has a lot of signs that point towards autism (more than I've mentioned here), though that's not certain. Interestingly, that same ""is he or isn't he autistic"" is hotly debated about the other character mentioned here, Sheldon. 

And if I'd had the good fortune to read these biographies back when they came out, I'd have just invested all my money with him. Truly, he's a remarkable individual.

Warren's sisters are extraordinarily intelligent (his older sister passed away in 2020).  I'm no slouch (National Merit Scholar and Mensa), but I had to be at the top of my game to stay in conversations with both of them.

His achievements certainly betray extreme intelligence but not all of them are as unusual as you make them out to be.

Doing taxes at 14—Most kids have a job at 15–16. I certainly did. Guess who did my taxes?

Not letting his children play with a train set—My dad has a couple of old comic books he treasures. Some are from his childhood (primarily Tintin and Asterix) and some are vintages (is that the word?) he purchased recently (lots of Avengers). I wasn't allowed to read any back when I was a kid. My dad isn't autistic.

Mental calculations—I competed in math competitions from 12—17. I'm neither autistic nor a savant. All the kids I knew serious about competitions tried to get better at arithmetic to A) mildly improve our speed in contests and B) to look smarter (mostly the latter). One of the exercises many of us did was prime factorize license plates when we sat in cars. Do that for a year and you get pretty good at division and unintentionally memorize many, many primes. Till today, I'm  good enough at arithmetic that I can convince someone I'm extremely intelligent and mathematically gifted. In reality, I almost got held back in 1st grade for an inability to do addition and I'm an idiot. I'd envision one can get good at arithmetic in much the same way: practice."

Biggest thing to me is his ethics and morals. A bunch of fund managers handle other people money Willy Nilly, not Warren. He says he never took the idea of handling others money lightly. It is this risk adversity, combined with his incredible longevity in the markets that leads to the genius that is Buffet. He started buying stocks at age 10, he had his dad buy them for him. But anyways he kept this going from age 10, and the curiosity bug never left him. Studying the greats before him like Graham, and Dod  etc. 

He and Charlie also discussed an early partner that left the firm , and burned out chasing excessive returns essentially. Warren and Charlie said this partner was just as smart as them, but the greed and lack of risk management leading to them blowing up. Essentially Warren and Charlie said they knew they would get ri ch eventually, largely via compounding. But this partner wanted to be rich tomorrow. And it caused them to crash and burn. So there is a realness to Buffet, honesty, and bluntness that is great and others can learn from. Speaking of which BRK is off to quite the hot start this year…"

No delay in language as a child either. I think a lot of his quirkiness can be explained by just being wildly intelligent as a child, which can be kind of alienating. 

I don’t think it’s just the IQ that made Buffett great. He would probably point to his temperament. The intellectual curiosity and interest are pretty important. He also approached investing with a combination of academic rigor and practicality that is pretty unique. He also had a lot of risk tolerance and a talent for sizing bets.

There’s lots of wildly intelligent, mildly autistic people in finance but not all of them make money. Fischer Black was one of the smartest people of the 20th century. I’d wager he probably had a few IQ points on Buffett. But he never succeeded in making much money on his own. Eventually Goldman hired Black and made oodles of money off of his ideas.

A couple notes. First, both he and Charlie have commented on how they've matured over the years, especially past middle-age. They've described themselves as being  ""quite annoying,"" or something like that, before 40 or 50.

Second is the influence of Dale Carnegie on Warren, as recounted in the AS biography. Warren took to ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as a manual on how to act. He didn't just take Carnegie's word for it, though. According to Alice, he rigorously A-B tested the advice, recorded the results, and ran a regression analysis on the results of using Carnegie's method. That's....unusual.

And if you've seen one of the videos of Warren's office tours, you'll note his Dale Carnegie certificate is still framed prominently in his office, all these decades later.

Took me 3 minutes in my head to do profits. Retraced thought process below with approximate time per step:

5,190,500,000-2,672,250,000 = 2,518,250,000 (10 seconds)

26,490,200,000 - 18,670,450,000 = 7,819,750,000 (10 seconds)

781,975/251,825 \~ 3.1 (10 seconds)

3.1\^(1/(2013-1996))=3.1\^(1/17) (5 seconds)

Using Newton's method:

x\^17=3.1 (5 seconds)

Guess x=1:

1 - (1\^17 - 3.1)/(17 \* 1\^16) = 1 + 2.1/17 \~ 1.1 (10 seconds)

x = 1.1 - (1.1\^17 - 3.1)/(17\*1.1\^16) (10 seconds)

= 1.1 - (1.1\^17 - 3.1)/(1.1\^17 \* 17 /1.1)  (5 seconds)

= 1.1 - ~~(1.1\^17)/(1.1\^17)~~ \* 1.1/17 + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16)  (5 seconds)

\~ 1.1 - 0.065  + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16)  = 1.035 + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16) (10 seconds)

1.1\^16=1.21\^8\~1.45\^4\~2.1\^2\~4.4 (20 seconds)

1.035 + 3.1/(17\*4.4) (negligible)

\~1.035 + 3.1/75 (5 seconds

\~1.035 + 1/25 = 1.035 + 0.04= 1.75 (5 seconds)

1.075 - (1.075\^17-3.1)/(17\*1.075\^16) (timing basically same as above)

= 1.075 - 1.075/17+3.1/(1.075\^16\*17)

\~ 1.075 - 0.06 + 0.18/(1.075\^16)

= 1.069 + 0.18/(1.075\^16)

1.075\^16\~1.17\^8\~1.4\^4\~1.9\^2\~3.6

=1.075 - 0.06+0.18/3.6

Which yields a CAGR of 6.5, just 6% low.

I maintain my opinion that he's far more intelligent than you or me, but this feat is by no means superhuman. I could probably cut down to 40 seconds given the obvious shortcuts I missed and my slowness in arithmetic if I put in work for two years. If I memorized powers of 1.07 since that's the average growth rate for many metrics, it would take all of 5 seconds. He's still much faster, but I've met several people who would be capable of sub-20 seconds calculations with practice. He's a genius, yes, but this specific feat isn't so brilliant you'll never meet anyone capable of doing it.

Regarding the reading thing, I can't claim to be a parent or upper-middle class : ( However, reading at a college level, even if not investing textbooks in particular, is still common enough. It's as much an interest issue as it is a difficulty issue. Speaking from personal experience, my mother learned English at 4 and was reading Dickens at 10 (which is high school level, arguably, but she did have a disadvantage). I'm a native speaker and read her copy of War and Peace at 9—the difficulty is exaggerated in popular culture but it's still best read at ages 17+—because I was curious what the fat book occupying half a shelf was about. I didn't understand everything, but that's because I'm not as intelligent as Buffet. I've met many people who were capable of such achievements at 7."

282,Thoughts on ACLS? - Long Position Thesis,2024-03-21 05:23:01,14.0,"**I. Business Overview**

Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (ACLS) specialises in designing, manufacturing, and servicing ion implantation and processing equipment for semiconductor chip fabrication. The Purion product line is preferred by leading semiconductor chip manufacturers worldwide. In 2023, 98.3% of ACLS’ revenue came from the ion implantation business, with the remaining 1.7% generated from aftermarket sales of legacy processing systems. 

Despite industry downturn, 2023 proved to be a remarkable year for ACLS. Thanks to the strong demand for their products and aftermarket support, ACLS achieved record revenue of $1,130.6 million and record earnings per share of $7.43.

&#x200B;

**II. Industry & Competition**

**-** ***Industry:***I will not bore you with unnecessary details in a well known industry, however, integrated circuits, commonly referred to as semiconductor chips, serve an ever-expanding array of consumer and industrial applications as technology progresses.

**-** ***Competition:***ACLS and Applied Materials (AMAT) stand as the sole manufacturers offering a comprehensive spectrum of ion implant systems; and as ACLS put it in their 10-K, there are also “non-U.S. suppliers \[that\] potentially hold an edge over their U.S. counterparts due to newly implemented U.S. export controls, particularly concerning shipments to China.”

&#x200B;

**III. Income Statement**

The Income Statement and Balance Sheet sections will mostly include information available in documentation such as the 10-K as I wish to highlight some key information to the reader that will provide a clearer picture to my long position thesis. While I will add some insight, most of it will come in the ‘Thesis’ section.

In 2023, the profit margin reached 21.78%, marking a notable increase of 9.45% compared to the previous year. Accompanying this impressive margin, ACLS achieved record earnings per share of $7.43.

ACLS has a trailing P/E ratio of 14.96 and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.66.

The consensus estimate EPS for Q1'2024 is anticipated to be lower than the actual EPS for Q1'2023, 1.24 and 1.43 respectively; I believe ACLS’ EPS will beat expectations, putting my lower estimate at 1.26 and the 2024 EPS estimate at 7.21.

&#x200B;

**IV. Balance Sheet**

Both total assets and retained earnings have shown a consistent upward trend over the past four years, steadily growing in accumulation.

Despite substantial debt liabilities still accumulating in the past four years, net income has consistently risen at a commensurate rate during the same period. Moreover, in 2023, the accumulation rate of assets exceeded that of debt liabilities (debt-to-asset ratio at 32.53%), signalling a strengthened balance sheet poised to support growth initiatives in 2024.

&#x200B;

**V. Thesis**

**-** ***Backlog and Demand for ACLS Products:***As of December 31, 2023, ACLS' backlog, including deferred systems revenue, amounted to $1,211.6 million, signalling strong demand for its products and services. This substantial backlog reflects positively on ACLS' market position and the perceived value of its offerings.

**-** ***Insider Buying Activity:***Following a decline in share price during the summer of 2023, directors and officers at ACLS have resumed purchasing company shares, reflecting their confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Notably, the CEO of ACLS purchased shares on March 11th, marking the first such instance since 2022, further indicating a positive outlook for the company's performance.

**-** ***Financial Performance Comparison with AMAT:***In comparison to AMAT, ACLS demonstrates similar Return on Assets (ROA) values, indicating comparable asset utilisation efficiency. Despite this parity, ACLS has exhibited more robust quarterly earnings growth year over year, positioning it favourably within the semiconductor equipment industry. Additionally, ACLS boasts a higher book value per share than AMAT, yet trades at a substantially lower price, suggesting potential undervaluation relative to its financial metrics and market performance.

**-** ***Stock Price Movement and Market Sentiment:***Despite operating within the same sector and industry, ACLS and AMAT have experienced divergent stock price movements since July 2023. While insider selling within ACLS may have initially contributed to a downturn, positive factors such as the release of a flattering 10-K report, a large order backlog, and the already existing undervaluation relative to ACLS’ intrinsic value suggest a potential rebound in ACLS's stock price. These developments, coupled with ACLS's successful turnaround from an accumulated deficit in 2021 to high increases in year to year retained earnings, indicate improved financial performance and growth prospects for the company.

**-** ***Risk Analysis:***With a High Value at Risk (VaR) of 26.47% and a negative Sharpe ratio, I perceive the VaR to be overstated due to its susceptibility to the downturn observed since the summer of 2023, compounded by the fact that prices are lingering at the lower end of the 52-week price history. Regarding the Sharpe ratio, the elevated VaR obscures the equally high annualised return of 33.24%. These assessments are based on data spanning the past decade (2013-2023), with the VaR calculated using the Cornish-Fisher method.

&#x200B;

**VI. Risks**

Non-U.S. suppliers potentially hold an edge over their U.S. counterparts due to newly implemented U.S. export controls, particularly concerning shipments to China.

Occasionally, inventory surpluses within the semiconductor device industry result in an oversupply of semiconductors. This oversupply can lead to diminished demand for capital equipment, including ACLS’ products, thereby adversely affecting their sales and profitability levels. This inventory build-up is cyclical and hard to predict accurately.

With a High Value at Risk (VaR) of 26.47% and a negative Sharpe ratio, I perceive the VaR to be overstated due to its susceptibility to the downturn observed since the summer of 2023, compounded by the fact that prices are lingering at the lower end of the 52-week price history.

These assessments are based on data spanning the past decade, with the VaR calculated using the Cornish-Fisher method.

Please let me know your thoughts on any long position in ACLS or conversely, a short position. I have left out data easily accessible within investor relations' documentation such as the 10-K with the exception of the most pertinent data needed to provide a picture for the reader to understand the context behind the thesis.","['or', 'III', 'well', 'up', 'wish', 'key', 'beat', 'four', 'be', 'net', 'it', 'an', 'for', 'by', 'out', 'me', 'any', 'on', 'has', 'Both', 'add', 'hard', 'ever', 'are', 'AMAT', 'VII', 'can', 'you', 'ACLS']",,

I will add some visualisation to the quantitative risk analysis:

I used a stock scanner to compile an index of a few companies (low P/E, >25% EPS Growth Y-to-Y, etc). With this index then I ran a model to calculate the following values.

As you can see the highest VaR of the index belongs to ACLS. I did mention in the main post why I believe this value is misleading.

[https://imgur.com/a/dFlh7q0](https://imgur.com/a/dFlh7q0)

Here are the annualised returns for the index over the same time period. Notice how ACLS tops the index once again but by an even higher margin.

[https://imgur.com/a/neCPCV5](https://imgur.com/a/neCPCV5) 

I then used the model to construct an efficient frontier that can determine the ideal portfolio at the tangent with the market line. I assumed the risk-free rate to be 4.25%, the long-term average rate of the 10 Year Treasury Rate (I:10YTCMR).

[https://imgur.com/a/EXhvhek](https://imgur.com/a/EXhvhek)

Now here is the most peculiar thing; despite the negative Sharpe ratio, ACLS still holds over 50% of the ideal portfolio weight. 2nd place goes to GNTX which holds the highest Sharpe ratio, the 2nd highest annualised returns and below average (comparative to the index compiled) VaR.

I cannot say I bring much insight within the semiconductor industry. My evaluations and positions are much more heavily influenced by quantifiable data, with a significant emphasis on stock price risk, rather than wider industry sentiment, but here are my two cents on it:

Financially the company is very healthy; long term debt does not pose an issue (even in the case of unfavourable results), and the same can be said for liquidity. They focus on R&D as well and have hundreds of patents, although I cannot provide technical insight into them.

The semiconductor industry is bullish now, and I think that many investors saw some ugly figures, risk wise, on ACLS' part and decided to shy away due to the high asking price of both the industry and ACLS, hence the downturn (insider selling did not help but they are buying again now, at least). Operations wise, ACLS is on par if not performing better than its main competitors despite a disappointing 2nd half of 2023 for investors; keep in mind the aggressive accumulation rate of retained earnings, however.

As for investing long-term, ACLS trades low enough and at a lower volume comparative to the market, such that the expected value of the investment is positive as to my estimation, which I provide in good faith but cannot vouch for the accuracy of third-party data gathered by me to reach this conclusion. To counter short-term volatility and get a more indicative price of the short-term market, averaging your cost-basis over a short span is viable.

The nature of the business, its customers, and the industry as a whole has the disadvantages of any industry intertwined with our global supply network; it's stuck in the middle of a power struggle, more specific to this case, the chip war between the US and the CCP as you said.

To the disappointment of my general investment theory, they are unquantifiable events. I believe semiconductors are hot and will stay hot unless US-China implications get too deep, at which point the entire technology sector will be affected. I got lucky with TSM early, but I wanted to increase my exposure to this market at a cheap price in relation to the industry. My belief is that ACLS has the fundamentals, a large order backlog reinforcing the value of its products, and the commitment to R&D to remain competitive and keep its leading position in ion implantation. This is my personal belief and concurrent with my investment circumstances specifically, however.

I'm sorry I cannot provide more information into the political aspect, but I shy away from political debates and theories without underlying data; not to say that I do not have opinions as anyone would. Tell me what you think are the assumed risks in this long position and its implications. One of the reasons I posted this here was to see if anyone has any unique insights on something I have neglected or entirely missed, or provide more information to strengthen my thesis."

I have a career/study-related question specific to my circumstances.  
So, currently I am set to graduate from BSc Management from a top London-based university, this July. Right now, I am taking a finance module (incl. corporate finance), but it is boring, to be honest. I love reading on value investing (I loved Pulak Prasad's book), choosing the right firm is kind of like a puzzle/challenge for me that 'has to be solved,' which I really enjoy.   
My initial idea was to go into an equity research/boutique IB role to train myself first and ""buy"" time to record my portfolio's performance. Actually, it was Mohnish Pabrai who advised me in a meeting at my school to create a separate brokerage account to record my performance.   
My objectives:  
I do not want to stuck in a place like Wall Street firms where nothing is about value in firms and it's just numbers and sales. I also don't know whether a finance entry-level job will be as boring as my corporate finance class. If yes, I'll honestly consider doing something else.   
   
Secondly, I love reading on all the interdisciplinary aspects related to value investing (it started after reading Poor Charlie's Almanack). Psychology, History, Evolution - I am just curious about the world and I don't want to be stuck in a simple role just sitting in front of a spreadsheet 12-16 hrs/day. I hate this kind of a life, so I have a dilemma.   
My options (right now) are:   
1) Find a job (finance or anything else, I don't know yet)  
2) Do a masters degree - but I also don't know in what, my best bet is Psychology or Behavioral Decision Science or Behavioral Economics, as it's all related to psychology.   
3) Other options, e.g. starting my own business or something else.  
   
The question is then - what do you all think about this?

CHATGPT
To calculate the present value
(PV) of the cash flows, we'll
discount each cash flow back to
its present value using the
provided discount rate and then
sum them up. Additionally, we'll
calculate the present value of the
perpetuity at the end of Year 5
using the correct formula.
Given:
Discount rate (r): 15%
Perpetual growth rate (g): 3%
Cash flows for each year: $20
million, $30 million, $15 million,
$25 million, $30 million
1. Discount each cash flow:
O Year 1: $20 million Y (1 +
0.15)^1 = $17.39 million
Year 2: $30 million / (1 +
0.15)^2 = $22.80 million
Year 3: $15 million / (1 +
0.15)^3 =$9.14 million
Year 4: $25 million /(1+
0.1 5)^4= $13.89 million
Year 5: $30 million (1 +
O
0.15)^5= $15.22 million
2. Calculate the present value of
the perpetuity at the end of
Year 5:
Perpetuity value =Year 5
cash flow/(1 +g)^n
Perpetuity value = $30
million / (1 + 0.03)^5
Perpetuity value = $30
million / 1.159274
O Perpetuity value u $25.88
million
3. Sum up the present values of
cash flows for years 1 to 5
and the present value of the
perpetuity:
◦ PV = $17.39 million +
$22.80 million + $9.14
million + $13.89 million +
$15.22 million + $25.88
million
PV z $104.32 million
So, the present value of the cash
flows is approximately $104.32

347,Brown Forman B shares $BF.B,2024-03-21 02:40:19,20.0,"This company popped up on the 52 week lows this week and i took a look.

Brown Forman, the makes of Jack Daniels whiskey/bourbon is a high quality, family-controlled business and is suffering from a global decline in spirit sales. This isn't a company specific problem as its larger peer Diageo has been experiencing world-wide challenges in sales as well.

**On being a high quality company:**

The company shares sells as a premium over Diageo (p/e of 26.04 vs 19.57)  and over MGPI (p/e 17.41).

I think it is a combination of:

+ higher efficiency ratios (BF has the highest ROE & ROIC among the three) and

+  conservative financial management  (Diageo has the highest Debt to Equity Ratio) and

+ free cash flow generation (highest FCF/Sales %)

But what truly makes this a very high quality stock is that this 154-year old company has been increasing its Dividends every year consecutively for the last 40 years.

**The company isn't without issues:**

- This is a family owned business, their voting A-shares are ill-liquid and their B-shares are what most people trade on, but B-shares don't get to vote,

- I don't really know what is the growth rate for the next two years since management dropped the ball during the q3 earnings call in early march. Sales is going to be flat from +3/+5, and operating income is going to be between 0 and +2.

-Historically, pre-covid, they did 7% cagr EPS growth, for the last 10 years, they did 5% cagr, in the last 5 years, the EPS cagr was only 3+%

- The dividend yield, while highest in the last 10 years (cheapest), is also quite low at 1.62%. The annualized growth rate is between   5.45% (last 5 years)  and 7.02% (year 10 years)

**How to think about investing in BF.B**

During Pandemic, sales from drinks establishment took a hit but was counter-balanced by more people drinking at home. Post pandemic, customers were hit with high inflation, reduced spending power, return to work.

So is the problem of declining sales a permanent impairment to the business? ie. Are people going to drink more alcohol  in the future or are more people going to give up alcohol like cigarettes  and lead a teetotaller or reduced alcohol lifestyle ? (Budweiser just had a year it would rather forget, in 2023 they experienced  17.5% decline in U.S. sales and a total decline in volume of 3.4%)

Now that DEO and BF are gearing up on marketing to drive sales, this is good for the long term, but the near term impact will be earnings. One silver lining is that the new Ready to Drink ""Jack and Coke"" is really doing well,  and is expected to go world-wide in April this year. It was announced and launched in 11 countries in 2022/2023  iirc. This RTD product is experiencing a higher 5% growth-rate.

I really dislike **time** as a catalyst, because it is so meh. But BF.B is at its cheapest now than it has ever been (see the tearsheet below), and it is cheap not because of mis-management.

If i have to make a bet, i bet that it will take two years for BF for the business to recover back to the long term 4% sales growth and 7% earnings growth, and the share price to go back up to $70 from the current price of $52 or 16% annualized for the next two years.

The no.1 risk i see in investing in this share is this: BF.B could be re-rated as a slow growth stock or maybe at most track like Diageo, especially since Diageo is also a dividend aristocrat (a company that increases it dividend annually for the last 25  years).

(disclosure: i bought a BF.B tracker stock yesterday at $52)

Here is a copy of my datasheet which i prepared yesterday: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnQu4-9EZY5NM18jiQcFOuSjPB3l-bmQ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnQu4-9EZY5NM18jiQcFOuSjPB3l-bmQ/view?usp=sharing)

this is just a simple one page pdf file with the data gleaned from several sources. i have blanked out the valuation method, but my numbers for the IV is between $57.59 and $43.10, blended using several methods. M\* has it at $59 while CFRA rates its as a HOLD with a 12 month target of $55.

355,The DFCF Model,2024-03-21 05:23:20,21.0,"Hello all,

I am curious as how heavily you rely on your Discount Free Cash Flow Model to give you your price targets. I do realize that not one metric is the ""end all be all"" to a financial decision. I'm still new to using the DFCF Model (about 20 tickers new) and have been using it with some of my current holdings. I noticed some of the positions I have done due diligence on have much lower price targets then my previous analysis has given me. How much percentage of the DFCF Model results determines your final decision. Is it say 20%, 60%, weight of your decision. Is DFCF Model just as simple as P/B (aka take it with a grain of salt). I know were generating Future Free Cash Flows here but how much of that really determines future price?

Looking forward to hearing your experience with this.

Have a good day!

I typically use the same assumptions for things like the discount rate, so now I look a the P/FCF ratio and that tells me whether the stock is priced as if it's going to shrink, grow very slowly, or grow quickly. From there, it should be obvious whether it's mispriced according to my understanding of the company and its competitive advantage.

I keep the math simple intentionally so that I don't put too much weight on it. At the end of the day, what we're really trying to do with the math is predict the future, which isn't possible, so if I do a full Wall St/Damoradan style DCF that requires 9 tabs of an Excel spreadsheet and takes an entire afternoon, my brain wants to put a lot of weight on the number that I come up with.

You said you did about 20, I would do at least another few dozen, maybe 100 more, just to get familiar with all the moving parts and how they impact the final valuation. If you're at all good at math (and here I don't mean ""have a PhD in advanced math,"" I mean ""understand how multiplication and division are inverses of each other and how percents work""), you'll find some shortcuts that get you to within a few percent of those exacting calculations and, for investing, that's good enough to tell whether something is obviously mispriced and worth a longer look or not.

To answer your question about how heavily I rely on my DCF computations ... it's ""totally"". Even though these are rough estimates at best, they're the absolute foundation of the system as a whole."

It has insane profit margins at 20% and has 3x revenue in about 4 years. All of its ratios point towards a significant discount and margin of safety, main threat to its price being that it is indeed just a fad and will not be able to keep its revenues.

I think sentiment has shifted a lot on CROX even in this subreddit. It's a fantastic company with a really strong brand, which is probably the only real moat you can have in this industry. Their cash flow relative to capex is absolutely insane, even compared to other shoe companies and like you said, they're cheap.

The ""fad"" element of their business has never bothered me. I think investors often don't understand that clothing fads are fundamentally different from, say, beanie babies. Clothing often become a part of a person's identity. For example, I got a pair of Asics running shoes in high school and, as an avid runner, have been buying them ever since and will never buy another brand. People become lifelong purchasers of these premium brands even after the ""fad"" dies down.

I also like that people buy Crocs for different reasons. My 10-year-old nephew buys them because his friends do and he likes the colors and design. My girlfriend who's a nurse buys them because they're comfortable and she's on her feet all day, as do all of the nurses she works with."

Then they complain about hey dude acquisition and their enormous debt that they have to take on. But look at their debt pay down rate! On 3/31/2021 their debt is 2.8 bil. As of 12/31/2023, it's 1.37 bil. At this rate they're projected to be debt free at the mid to end of next year. And oh by the way, they are decreasing their share count by about 3% a year for the past 10 years. 

At today's PE of 10, it's still undervaluled. Fundamentally speaking, they are a lot more profitable than Skechers, Deckers, Nike, On, and etc. plus their shoes is literally just rubber, maybe costs about $5 max to make (injection molding is cheap) with no intensive labor involved. They are light weight and takes a lot less space to store than your traditional shoe boxes.

People say how other companies can just copy their rubber shoes. However, I've tried out a lot of them. No one makes Crocs that doesn't feel flimsy and smells bad after a day of wearing them. Only Crocs can make Crocs"

1) cross-generational/ cross-activity appeal. “Uncool” olds buy them for comfort.

2) yes repeat buying. They fill a unique niche similar to Birkenstocks but they’re cheaper and have wider appeal as a result. And easy to buy/repeat buy. (Similar market cap as birk which is significantly overvalued)

3) China market growth (if they can replicate the popularity of Arcteryx—a wayyyy more $$$ product, golden!), new designs (risk would be moving too far away from core but so far they’ve been good moves imo), and even if not hyped front and center, there is a strong base and immune from social media fadness

With what, LOL?  Debt doesn't get paid off with Revenue, it gets paid off with FCF.   
 At best, if they devote 100% of FCF to paydown of debt (after maintenance CapEx), and 0% to growth CapEx, they might be able to pay down 40% of the debt in the next 5 years.  But they've already made clear they will NOT be doing that b/c they intend to begin allocating some FCF to growth.  If they don't, Revenue will start shrinking.

The goal is to devote maximum FCF to debt paydown for the next 2 years, get the debt to equity down to 3.0, and then slow down debt paydown, and use that leverage to advantage as the debt is fixed at rates lower than they believe they can grow. It's a nice plan, but can they execute. Zaslov, on a pure performance basis, has been one of the most overpaid CEOs in the world over the last decade. He's also bungled and bumbled more things than not in this transition.

Value investing requires you to buy stocks at a discount large enough so that you have a margin of safety to protect against loss if your thesis doesn't play out.  
  
On the other hand, you can also have success by adhering to a growth investing philosophy. Growth investors will happily pay a premium for stocks if their growth potential is significant enough. If the stock is able to actually achieve those high levels of growth, the rewards can be significant... but, the lack of a margin of safety means that if for some reason that growth is not achieved, the stock has a very long way to fall.

Moreover, dating apps are highly dependent on you not finding a long term relationship because that means you will most likely no longer need the app. Most of their revenue seems to be generated through ads which means that their only interest is to keep people swiping left or right and hopefully clicking on an ad that pops up. Of course, they're probably collecting other data off users too. But again, I'm not sure how a small subset of men can provide future growth."

Housing market trends are shaping up in favor of a solid 2024 for U.S. homebuilders — as long as mortgage rates don’t jump back to the highs they hit late last year. All the homebuilder sector analysts have increased their target price for homebuilders in anticipation of rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

With lower interest rates, homebuilders don't need to offer incentives anymore to bring the rates down and this will increase their profit margins immensely.

On the flip side, the advantage homebuilders have in high interest rate economy is they can cut in their profit margins and offer incentives to lower the rates to new home buyers. Historically, pre-COVID era, profit margins for homebuilders were between 18-20%, and right now they are between 22-24%, so they still have some room to attract new home buyers.

Lennar (LEN), Pulte (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) have established themselves as industry titans who offer more affordable entry level homes to first time homebuyers.

Everyone excepted a housing crash in 2022 because rates rose rapidly, so the builders became exceedingly cheap. Why didn't this happen? 1. Homeowners locked into very low rates and thus didn't sell 2. Housing supply overall remained low largely due to a lack of construction over the previous 10 years in response to the GFC. So, while rates did hurt demand, a lack of supply more than offset lower demand. Given that current homeowners were unwilling to sell, the only game in town became new home construction. Add millenials (a much larger generation than Gen X) entering peak home buying age, more people living alone or in small households, and a growing political trend away from strict zoning laws will keep fundamentals in new housing construction strong for the next 10-15 years.

The connection isn’t as straightforward as people believe because homebuilders use the excess margin to pay incentives to reduce the mortgage rate.

Home builders have been using incentives like “buydowns” where they pay to reduce the effective mortgage rate the buyer pays. Right now a 30 year fixed is 7.6% but with buydowns this can come down to 5% or so. This buydown comes straight out of homebuilder margins. So far the homebuilders have been able to pay these incentives and still deliver record gross margins. I’m not sure how sustainable that is.

Some other things to consider:

1) a bunch of new apartment supply is coming online right now across the nation. This could dent the demand for detached houses. If prices for single family houses go up further, more people may “give up” the idea of owning and just go to the nice apartment which just got cheaper. 

2) increasing concentration in housing suppliers. The homebuilders market position might shift a bit. Housing suppliers used to be a really fragmented industry. Housing suppliers (companies like Topbuild or Builders Firstsource, etc) have rolled up some smaller players and may be able to exert a bit more pressure on pricing. 

3) land prices. I’ve been seeing more and more homebuilders drawing down on the amount of owned/controlled land they have. Land prices, like everything else, have moved up a lot. Eventually homebuilders will have to come back out and grab some more land which will squeeze margins if they can’t raise price further. 

With several potential threats on margins, I’m not totally sure the builders can keep up the pace of incentives. So even if the Fed cuts rates, may not directly translate into positive environment for homebuilders."

Only negative I can find is that their payout ratio is high, several analysts raised the issue on the last earnings call, but management is confident the current payout is sustainable given the visibility and security of future cashflows.

Whether it deserved a premium of 19x because of the ultra stable government tenants is a question, but it will take a long time if ever to get back to that valuation. But at 10x right now and no rate hikes in the future, it's probably worth a look.

Office REITs specifically are not going to do well because REITs trade on real estate valuations and office values are potentially facing a very long bear market. Whether this is priced in with single digit valuations is possible, but I would take a speculative bet at best. The highest quality office REIT is ARE, its biotech offices are less affected by WFH, low debt, and located in AAA next to universities, but it's also priced that way at 14x. 

Besides office, other CRE are doing just fine because 1) Industrials have ultra low default rates due to targeted government stimulus, great US economy, and actually benefit from WFH, 2) Retail is having a renewal from post-pandemic travel 3) MF is just fine because rents have risen quite a lot. From what I can see, retail mall REITs are not trading very cheap and it's not known when post-covid boom will soften, so they aren't a buy here. Industrials are doing really well, they would have been decent buys the last time we had an inflation scare in Oct, but haven't had a major correction. They might be a buy just because industrials are doing so well. Non-mall retail like O and ADC are probably decent here, they're kind of cheap now. Medical REITs also aren't doing well because hospital costs have risen, they also have that ""specialization"" risk because there are not a lot of hospital buyers, but one I like is CHCT due to the low valuation and relatively low debt. MF REITs are also decent buys here, they haven't been this cheap in a while and I don't really see any issues with multifamily right now, something like MAA and CPT. Maybe there's some risk there with an apartment supply boom, but it seems to be priced in to me.

""F Wall Street"" by Joe Ponzio (worst name ever for a fund manager)

This book is a complete value investing system, from ""this is what stocks are,"" to ""how to assign a valuation to a company,"" to ""here's how to run a portfolio after you've done all your research.""

I've read the ""big ones"" over the last about 16 years, Graham, Fisher, Greenblatt, Klarman (all great, btw, not throwing shade their way) ... but F Wall Street is head and shoulders above everything else I've read in terms of simplicity and completeness.

One cautionary statement would be that it doesn't do analyst level DCF like Damoradan, it's a quick-and-dirty version. I use the quick version and whenever Damoradan does one he and I are usually within a few % of each other, so I stick with something that lets me make a quick decision about whether to do a deeper dive into a company."

The books that come up regularly (Intelligent Investor, Margin of Safety if you can get a copy of it, Common Stocks, etc) are GREAT and every value investor should read them. Even if they can be somewhat dated, it's really useful to have the same ""educational background"" as other really successful investors. So, for example, when Buffett talks about chapters 8 & 13 of the Intelligent Investor (I think those are the two he mentions), you know that he's talking about the margin of safety and mr. market chapters.

1. Matt Harris discusses the critical future challenges facing banks, focusing on technological disruptions and the aftermath of financial instabilities.

2. He expresses a personal affection for banks but remains critical of their future in the face of technological innovation and changing financial landscapes.

3. He points out the significant impact of interest rate fluctuations, evidenced by the collapse of three major banks, indicating systemic vulnerabilities.

4. Harris highlights the growing problem of non-performing commercial real estate loans, exacerbated by persistently high interest rates, posing serious risks.

5. The inertia of consumers in financial decision-making is criticized, suggesting a shift in the sustainability of the traditional banking model due to changing interest rates and the introduction of real-time payment systems.

6. He anticipates a paradigm shift in banking, propelled by fintech innovation, challenging the traditional net interest margin model and questioning the future role of banks.

7. Harris suggests strategic responses for banks, including technology-driven product bundling and enhancing brand loyalty, to mitigate customer attrition and adapt to the competitive landscape.

8. He emphasizes the necessity for banks to engage in mergers and acquisitions to achieve scale and navigate the forthcoming ""messy phase,"" urging regulators to facilitate this transition."
595,Creative Realities $CREX - Discover a cheap and hidden high margin recurring revenue business,2024-03-20 11:06:09,29.0,"Share price: $4.20   
Market cap: $44 million   
Revenue guidance 2024: $60-80 million  
Recurring revenue 2024: $18 million  
Backlog: $110 million  


Creative Realities $CREX is one of the largest digital signage companies in the US. Beneath the hardware part of their business lies the true gold - the high margin SaaS solution which comes with every screen the company installs. Below I summarise why I think this is a good investment opportunity which hasnt been reconized by the broader market.   
$CREX has a bit of messy history with multiple predecessors until the current CEO took lead of the company. Multiple acquisitions led to a complete platform of hardware (screens), software (SaaS) and services. The company got his current form in 2021 and has survived the difficult COVID years. This is the reason the chart looks kind of ugly longer term. Simply put, it was a different company back then.

in 2023 a private equity company tried to buy $CREX three times, their final offer was $2.85 and got declined by the management. In the following months that same PE company refused to renegotiate terms on a loan which caused management to do a small equity raise (CEO, CFO bought in as well). That raise will be sufficient until Q1/Q2 2024 when the company turns the free cashflow positive corner. The last few quarters they have been paying down debt quickly which leads to an improved balance sheet and more firepower in a highly fragmented market.

Tomorrow pre market $CREX releases FY2023 earnings and they will update 2024 guidance (narrow it down). Even at midpoint of their guidance it will mean a significant rise in revenue (+50%). They will print free cashflow in Q1 or Q2 2024 and will have a significant lower debt. Recurring revenue will be in focus, it probably will be covering all OPEX in 2024. All incremental $ will fall to bottom line. 

You can still buy into this growing business for less than 1x 2024 revenue and around 2 times 2024 ARR. I think there is a fair chance for the twin engine to ignite (multiple expansion and underlying growth).

This was just a quick note, there is much more to investigate and like when you dig a bit deeper (AI, Third party licensing of software, international rollout, new customers signed in 2024). I suggest watching a recent interview with the CEO on Planet Microcap.

Swing trading requires a solid plan/strategy - much harder to implement, extensive research required to maintain large watchlists for potential trades, more paperwork/taxes, higher returns, easier to beat the market. Buy good businesses low, sell higher, repeat.

I think people start getting into trouble when they half-ass it. Ie., selling your investment, but then don't really have a plan for what to do afterwards...

I bought at $52.22 and figured it would rebound at least 20% when the dust settled. I figured this would be a short term hold. It closed at $61.31 today.

What do the viable alternatives look like?

Right now a good course of action to perform a trade study against is the performance of a 5% money market fund. By keeping your money invested in your current position, you forego the 5% opportunity. That's a real cost.

If your current position will return 5%, the decision is a wash. (ignoring taxes)

But another trade study would be XYZ corp. I have a hot tip that XYZ Corp is going to do 30%. In that case, you really want to close your current position and buy XYZ.

I haven't really answered your question though. Other people hit on it. You need a solid rationale for comparing your current position to the viable alternative opportunities.

I'm a weak value investor. I do look at fundamentals and price. I have done liquidation value (Graham style) value analysis. I have not done a proper discounted cash flows (Buffet style) yet. That means I don't have a viable price target. I lack a quantitative rationale.

I have a qualitative exit point for my long term investments. When crude oil tankers start coming out of the ship yards near the end of 2027, that's when I start thinking about closing my position. The supply/demand consideration will turn against me. I also have to consider the ""peak oil"" idea.

Maybe you have a more qualitative rationale that you can use? E.g. you postulate the EVs are going to eat the market and decide to bet against gasoline producers.

Consider the current position in light of the viable alternatives. Consider opportunity cost."

Hi! I wanted to pick your brains on the subject of valuation methods for real estate companies/developers (keep in mind I am NOT talking about valuing a real estate property). I know there are quite a few methods available (like DCF, and NAV, among others) but what about valuing a company that has property over terrains/land that are not being developed. For example, if developer x has property over a 5-acre piece of land, how would you value the company? Would you make a forecast based on the prospect of that land later becoming a development? Or would you just take it as an asset/property without any special consideration?

This has been bugging me since this is not just any company, but a real estate developer, so what method should I use or what special (if any) considerations should I take in order to value the enterprise?

646,Terminology Question / Type of Gain,2024-03-20 23:18:14,33.0,"I need a little help with terminology so I can search out the correct... umm... terminology.

Say that I deposit $1,000 into an account. I trade $1,000 each day and make $100 for 30 consecutive days. The gain on each transaction is 10%.

At the end of the month I will have $3,000 in gains plus my initial $1,000 deposit for a balance of $4,000. The gain on the initial deposit is 300%.

It seems to me that investing pros would have some different terminology to distinguish the gain on the initial deposit from the gain on each transaction.

While top-line revenue has grown steadily for years, the stock price hasn't kept pace. This is largely due to an Australian tax program that masks their true profitability. They've generated nearly 50% of their market cap in free cash flow (FCF) over the last few years, with FCF doubling over the past three years. This positions MSV.AX to reward shareholders handsomely.

Currently, Mitchell Services is laser-focused on returning capital to shareholders. They're delivering a substantial 12% dividend yield while exploring share buybacks. With a strong growth track record and a commitment to shareholder value, MSV.AX offers a compelling mix of income generation and significant upside potential as the market recognizes its true financial strength.

So overall, you are saying that due to this program, expenses are ""artificially"" higher (due to the write-off), which is resulting in a lower tax expense, but FCF is not affected due to non-cash nature of write-off expenses, which allows for higher FCF generation for the next two years?

Does this create a deferred tax asset balance that will need to be paid in the future?

But yes this is causing much higher free cash flow for the next year and a half to 2 years but they’ll still have the ability to keep growing with instant write offs. 

If we assume they drop their D&A write off from $18m today to $2-$4m with everything else the same, this would impact FCF by about $4m/year due to tax expenses but by the time that impacts the company they’ll already be making $2m-$4m more in FCF due to the compounding effects of the business taxes saved.

So if you want to calculate earnings you can probably just add $12m (USD) to earnings which would be a close-ish approximation which would be ~$20m, or $23m in normalized FCF. By the time the program dies off I think FCF will be sustainable around $27m-$30m assuming not much growth thereafter so a 8x multiple seems very conservative. Even if we say $25m in 2 years of FCF that’s at least a valuation of $200m (USD). Which is nearly 4x current EV."

This information is vital for effectively approaching potential prospects.

Platforms like CapitalIQ, Bloomberg, and Mergermarket are currently quite expensive and I don't need to use everything they offer.

694,Interview with mutual fund manager,2024-03-20 09:02:01,38.0,"
Hi i am a long time lurker and high school senior. Recently, I cold-connected on LinkedIn with a mutual fund manager in the industrials and energy space (Scott Barbee) and he was surprisingly willing to have a conversation with me. I assume this is rare so please don’t inundate him with requests lol.

He is pretty well known in his niche given he has been in the top decile of performance over the last 3, 5, and 10 year timeline and has outperformed the S&P 500 and Russel 2000 since inception, with 11% net CAGR over last 25 years.

I am reading previous interviews he has had, but Given this opportunity, I want to come with some pretty solid questions lined up. Does anybody have any they would like to ask?

Here is what I have so far and intend to ask about one of his core positions that I actually did a research report on to win finalist in a stock pitch competition

- [ ] Undergrad education focus and importance in career?
- [ ] Opinion on specializing earlier in your career? Your background gives you a unique perspective with your dad working for Aramco and interning at Chevron then Simmons.
- [ ] Opportunity to start the aegis value fund post-MBA?
- [ ] You have one of the largest personal holdings I’ve seen for a mutual fund manager, do you think this gives way to a more balanced psychology when investing?
- [ ] What is the type of investor you like in your fund? Your deep value strategy naturally needs a contrarian perspective but how do you deal with fund investors being part of the consensus?
- [ ] Have you felt any fee compression pressure and what is your opinion on the future of the mutual fund structure versus that of the hedge fund?","['top', 'am', 'well', 'up', 'You', 'when', 'do', 'post', 'he', 'net', 'for', 'me', 'Hi', 'fund', 'any', 'has', 'cold', 'way', 'He', 'on', 'rare', 'you', 'so']",,

The fact that you are doing this in high school is immensely impressive, so don’t let my comment minimize what you are doing.

I’ll definitely mention AI to him and his thoughts on the affects on his strategy (probably minimal as he does on site visits to management with unique contrarian view). 

Also do you think it is alright to attach my resume and my equity research on one of his top holdings I want to talk about.? Though I’m very happy to just speak to him, an internship this summer with his fund would be amazing."

As for OXY, I expect that my great-grandchildren will still be using products made from the distillates of petroleum.

I took Warren's comments to be his take on what BRK would continue to hold five or six decades after he passes away.

They went a little overboard on Star Wars content, and audience engagement started to dip. But I can’t fault Disney for that- it’s Star Wars after all. At the end of the day, having 1000+ characters to pull from is a massive win in my book. Regarding Disney, Buffet once said something like “The best part is that the Mouse doesn’t have an agent”. It’s the same for Captain America, Spiderman, all of the Marvel characters. It will take time to distill down the best use for each- but they’re all valuable resources.

Edit- And to bring it back to your main point, as long as Mickey isn’t making snuff films, I think Disney will be ok. People trip over themselves to get a chance to work at Disney (much like Apple). Thats the type of employee loyalty you really want with a family friendly company. 

I don’t know where things will be in the next 5 years. I think Iger needs to go, if nothing else to add some idea of stability for the next decade or so. But in 50 years, I have no doubt Disney will still be around, kids will love Mickey, and dads will be paying for DisneyWorld."

831,The U.S. market-cap weighted index bubble,2024-03-19 21:24:36,40.0,"I would like input to help me complete this post--it is a work in progress. It's purpose is to present the case that the U.S. stock market is overvalued due to the existence of a bubble. I'm posting this to the value investing forum because I do believe that value investing is superior to growth investing and speculating; I also think the bubbles' burst will result in value investors outperforming by a wide margin.

**What is a market-cap weighted index?**

It is a compilation of stocks like the S&P 500 which you can find more about [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) Basically, you invest money into a basket of stocks. A higher percentage of your investment goes to each company depending on its size. If you were to invest in the s&p  on March 19, 2024, about 7% of your dollar would purchase Microsoft, 6% would purchase apple and 5% would purchase Nvidia. These are the three largest components of the S&P 500 index. .01% of your dollar would go to smaller s&p 500 companies such as paramount and news corp.

**What is an equal-weight index?**

This is an index that holds all of the companies in an index at a fixed rate.  If you were to invest in an equal-weight index tracking the s&p  on March 19, 2024, .2% of your dollar would purchase Microsoft, .2% would purchase Nvidia, .2% would purchase paramount and newscorp as well. This type of index has flaws and is not a magic alternative to a market-cap weight index.

**The rise of passive investing**

Studies have shown that most active money managers underperform major market indices over time. This has led to huge inflows into instruments that track indices. It is claimed that between 80%-94% of all active managers under-perform the s&p depending on the [period of time.](https://www.ginsglobal.com/articles/94-of-us-fund-managers-underperform-sp-500-over-20-years/) Furthermore, it is claimed by Nassim Taleb in his book, *Fooled by Randomness*, that most active managers who out-perform indices do so because they are lucky. I have observed this when I hear them talk on bloomberg and cnbc and after I read their shareholder letters and youtube videos.

**Ok, so what's the problem**

The problem is that the s&p 500 index is a market weighted index and it is objectively expensive. It is currently trading around 38x free cash flow, 2.8x price to sales and 28x shiller p/e.

Yes, there is an equal weighted alternative to the s&p but its assets under management are insignificant. This market-weighted index of 500 companies now holds 80% of *all* U.S. market capitalization. Inflows have caused the index to be extremely top-heavy with the top 26 largest holdings quoting at 50% of the index's value. 50%! This is not due to the cash flows these companies are generating!!

**The top of the S&P is made up of extremely large overvalued companies**

Microsoft: 7% of the index trades at 46x fcf. It's price to FCF was 8 in 2009. Microsoft's growth prospects were just as good in 2009 as they are today yet the company is 6x the price

Apple: 6% of the index trades at 25x fcf. it's price to fcf was 11 in 2009 Apple's growth prospects are worse now than they were in 2009, with increasing competition in China and having successfully saturated developed market with iphones and other tech hardware.

Nvidia: 5% of the index trades at an extreme valuation with no basis in past results. Nvidia produced $3.8 billion in fcf in fy 23 yet its market capitalization is over $2 trillion

I'd guess that the market-weighting has resulted in roughly a $10 trillion bubble affecting the largest 40 or so s&p 500 companies. These companies are being bid-up by investor inflows into market weighted indices post-covid. Their earnings, sales, growth prospects, free cash flow ratios and growth do not support their current valuations. $10 trillion is one fifth of the U.S. stock market's valuation and it is built on nothing except inflows into market cap-weighted indices like the S&P 500. This bubble could help explain why the total us stock market is [expensive.](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/)

The extent of the bubble is determined by how overvalued you think s&p companies are, particularly the top-end of the market.

**Retail inflows since 2020**

There has been a speculative bonanza since covid. Retail investors have piled into stocks, with net inflows at about $2 trillion which is 5% of the total value of the U.S. equity market. [Just look at this insane chart.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-u-s-retail-investor-inflows-2014-2023/) Retail investors are speculating on stocks like microsoft, apple and nvidia and they are buying market-weighted indices like the S&P. In Berkshire's 2023 shareholder letter, warren buffet likened today's investors to gamblers and wrote that he did not anticipate this much speculative behavior in the market. The post-covid retail inflows help demonstrate why speculative behavior is increasing--a loss of faith in institutions have fostered a ""do it yourself"" mentality amongst novice investors.

**What's going to happen**

Over 70% of retail investor aum is owned by people [58 and over.](https://www.broadridge.com/_assets/pdf/broadridge-insights-on-us-investor-data-study.pdf) If there's an event that sparks panic in the market, these people are going to get their smart phones out and all sell the same stuff because they own the same stuff. They are also all retired or are retiring soon. The result will likely look like the covid sell-off only on steroids, because valuations are much higher than they were four years ago.

With recent retail investor in-flows totaling $2 trillion, I'd expect to see at least that much leave at about the same time selling much of the same stuff.

**This issue is worldwide**

Global passive investing fund assets now exceed active investing aum. Almost all of those assets are in [market-weighted index funds](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-funds-passive-2024-02-01/). I would guess there is tens of trillions of dollars in market cap  allocated to the world's largest companies that is granted by way of market-weighted index fund inflows. The U.S. stock market is about  $50 trillion and the entire world equity markets are worth about $100-110 billion. A downturn in U.S. stocks will likely impact equity markets around the world.

Most of Microsoft's growth last year was about Microsoft Azure. Something like 30%. But only 1/5th of that growth (6%) was down to AI. The rest was just an increase in cloud hosting. Probably companies shifting from on-prem to cloud rather than increased demands.

There's more and more AI-related boards appearing, even based on RISC-V and a few people are starting to wake up to the fact that NVDA may not have this unassailable moat.

And all it will take is a couple of companies not getting huge growth and the late entry investors will panic and run from this stuff, and they'll be a run.

Also of note: as these companies have pushed up SPY this has led to more money going into SPY which boosts all other stocks in the index. If people start dumping SPY it won't just affect the Mag 7."

885,Emerging Markets exposure questions,2024-03-20 14:14:04,41.0,"Hi,  


I am a newbie investor located in EU and i am currently holding and buying a combination of IWDA + EMIM ETFs for Developed and Emerging makert exposure..  
The allocation i currently hold is something like 60% IWDA + 40% EMIM  
I strongly believe that emerging markets will rise in the future and i am willing to bet on it..  
There are some countries , like Indonesia , Mexico , Brazil , Nigeria that i would like to have a bit more exposure than EMIM give me..  
Indonesia for example has currently less than 2% representation in EMIM which makes it less than 1% of my total portfolio.  


How can i achieve a bit bigger exposure on some countries of interest?

  
Does it make sense to buy some ETFs that focus on those countries as an addition to my portfolio or the rebalancing from the ETF itself will be sufficient to cover those markets in the future if they start to have a bigger share?  
Or maybe holding some individual stocks from each of those countries is a better option?  
Which option will give me more returns in case the markets in those specific countries rise?

I guess in terms of risk it goes like Individual Stocks > Country Based ETF > EMIM ETF

What other kind of exposure to those countries of interest will be good options besides the stock market?  


Thank you in advance for your insights.

Couple reasons why I never bought it:

1. Germany , German Banks and state governments use and rely on it like a interest generating piggy bank which sustains large amount of employment, supports huge chunks of the local industries, funds taxes, etc. which means it will be expected to spend most of its generated revenue in one way shape or form and that will always take precedence over maximizing shareholder return. It's the same for companies in Japan, Korea, China.
2. Permanent super high capital expense requirements for machinery and equipment to stay in business and relevant, and now also software and electrical engineering.

•	Once you have an estimate, you have to decide how confident you are in it.
•	You need multiple years.  This is hard…  

PE is a fine measure of a stock as a quick & dirty heuristic for cheap/expensive.  Its biggest limitation is that the earnings in question (let’s say we are using TTM PE) may not be representative of the earnings in the future.  If they are not, the information value is very low.  If the earnings of the company are very steady, suppose approaching the reliability of a government bond, the ratio is quite useful.

I usually try to estimate a “normalized” earnings level for the company if I am interested in it.  In many (most) cases, I am not able to sensibly do that, so I just put the company in the “too hard” pile and move on.  But when I can, the metric is useful."

For example, even in 1996 early dotcom, 30Y was around 7%. Meaning you could lock in what would be considered today obscenely generous yields with far less of an uncertain inflation outlook (at least IMHO). So obviously, valuations today are not even remotely comparable

This is a really solid point, but it's not clear what to actually do about it. If you were to consider multiples in the context of interest rates, you would probably conclude the US market is overvalued as a whole and not invest in it, or only very little. Actually, maybe this is a fair conclusion. But for an equity investor is going to put money into stocks and just wants to know which ones, rather than whether to do it at all, not very useful.

Also interest rates change... if they came down in future, then it would make no sense to avoid stocks today, in fact that would probably cause you to buy at a higher price later (depending why rates come down)

> Since 2019 when the ample reserves / floor system became the official policy stance of the Fed, the chance of an event like Covid creating lost decades became dramatically less. Meaning the chance stocks get semi-permanently crushed also diminished.

> And PE comparisons do not reflect this significant reduction in risk

Mmm, this is a potentially dangerous line of thought IMO. Stocks can suffer regardless of what the central bank does. See how long it took Japan's market to recover from the 1989 crash in spite of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Stocks are risky and always will be. I don't think one should conclude the risk is less now than in the past"

It can be justified, if you chose to believe: (a) future multi-year growth will be very strong or (b) rates will collapse and we will return to the old regime, but these are leaps of faith.

The rate might be historically low, but by the same token, multiples are historically high. The overall historical average 10Y yield is something like 4%, and stocks at 6% e/p, i.e a risk premium of 2%, which is about right. But currently the 10% is 4.3% with stocks e/p 3.8% or 4.9% forward, i.e. virtually no risk premium. This isn't right, and it can only be justified in one of the two ways mentioned in previous comment. If you simply look at what is, without plugging in favourable guesses for the future, the US market is overvalued relative to interest rates. You could do this via DCF and you would reach the same conclusion.

1007,CEIX - stock pitch (to myself),2024-03-19 12:17:13,51.0,"Hi all,

Before I buy or sell any stock, I do a one page summary to myself. Here's my pitch to myself so I can re-review later and remember what I was thinking. I hope it helps others.

Feel free to review and point out why I might be wrong....:-)

Current price (18-3-24): $81    
CEIX are a US low-cost producer of bituminous coal. Most of its revenue comes from thermal coal, however it sells around 10% of metallurgical coal for steel making and industrial applications. Metallurgical coal comes from the company’s Itmann mine. The company has been going for over 100 years,  but CEIX formed in 2017 when the gas and coal operations separated. it uses a well established long wall mining technique. Over 71% of its coal is exported using CEIX own shipping terminal (CONSOL Marine Terminal which is also well connected to 2 different rail routes). Exports and metallurgical coal are growth areas for the business as US scales back on fossil fuels. Here’s why I think CEIX is a buy:  
\-	The current P/E is 3.66 and P/S is 0.94  
\-	Return on Capital Employed is 35%  
\-	Free Cash Flow payout is 18%  
\-	Operating margin is 30% (net 25%)  
\-	Current ratio of 1.35   
\-	Debt is decreasing  ($2.5bn in 2017 to $1.3bn in 2023) whilst assets have remained constant.  
\-	It’s one of the most efficient operators in the market, with the PAMC mine in Pennsylvania managing 7.6 tons extracted per employee compared to a US average of 3.6  
\-	It’s average revenue per ton of coal is $76 whilst the average cost is $36 per ton.  
\-	Whilst coal usage in the developed is being phased out, coal still accounts for around 30% of global energy demand, with India and China being the main consumers. It will take decades to phase coal out as an energy source. Coal has some distinct advantages over renewables – it’s in abundant supply, it’s easy to mine, transport, store and provides a guaranteed energy source (as opposed to wind and solar). It doesn’t require special equipment such as LNG does with cooling and pressurised containers.  
Taking a DCF view, using CEIX’s average metrics over the last 5 years produces the following:  
FCF growth	P/E ratio	Discount rate%	Future share price $	Comment  
5%	4	10	105	FCF growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 years  
10%	4	10	132	  
20%	4	10	204	  
  
Another way to think of it is what’s the coal worth if you could sell it (below uses a simple model) with pricing per ton over the next 10 years (assuming that’s when demand optimistically vanishes).  
 	Coal price over 10 yrs $	Extraction cost next 10 years	Tons extracted	Value next 10 years  
High	100	70	35,000,000	10,500,000,000  
Med	80	60	26,000,000	5,200,000,000  
Low	70	50	15,000,000	3,000,000,000  
  
I see a potential upside of 50% over the next 5 years. The main risks being a transition away from coal at an accelerated and unexpected pace leading to significant falls in the global coal price.

Natural gas prices are at the bottom right now and will probably go up. They pledged massive by backs. I think good things are in the future. 50 percent upside in 5 years is too low. This is a 2-5x depending on the price of coal and a market retailing of P/E ratio when they realize they still are going to need coal for a long time. Oh and they are mining more coaling coal now which isn’t going away for 60 years. You need it to make steel, all these high rises and electric vehicles etc."

The general expectation is that seaborne coal will decline, but by how much depends on which research report you read (IEA have 16% by 2026), whereas S&P global market intelligence and IHS Markit report a flat\\slow decline up to 2030.

Finding the information on contracts and prices is proving tricky, in 2022 35% of revenues came from contractual agreements. Typically they sign multi year contracts.

I take your point about the decline of seaborne trade, but I believe the risks are already baked into the price.

Another potential catalyst is a Trump presidency may offer some encouragement for coal producers."

1015,Are large caps outperforming because small caps are losing money?,2024-03-19 02:41:29,52.0,"I've gone through largely all the US-based public companies under a 2B market cap (roughly 2,000), and if I had to summarize the experience, I'd call it disappointing. Just to clarify, when I say ""gone through"", I mean I've tried to replicate the Value Line experience by quickly looking over the business description and financial history of the company through my favourite stock screener. Once in a while, something will leap off the page and I'll give the company a deeper look.

Pretty much everywhere you look in the small cap world, things kinda suck. Companies are losing money, dilution is very common, the brands that you come across are almost entirely unknown (to me at least) and yet (I have no data at hand to back this up) for many of these mediocre businesses the multiples are still holding up. I have seen disappointing growth curve after disappointing growth curve (a sharp drop in a longer-term growth trend in revenues or profits) and in many cases valuations remain optimistic. But in terms of obvious bargains? I've found zero that I could put half my net worth in tomorrow and be able to sleep that night.

Checking the returns of the S&P indices shows a similar story:

* S&P 500: **12.69%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P MidCap 400: **8.86%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P SmallCap: **6.07%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN

Will this large-cap outperformance go on forever? Over the last 10 years, the spread gets a bit tighter:

* S&P 500: **10.65%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P MidCap 400: **7.72%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P SmallCap: **6.50%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN

Yet how come large and mid caps have done better in the last 5 years than in the last 10 years, and the opposite is true for the small caps? Did I miss the memo on earnings and free cash flows of small businesses being only worth half that of large ones? Do mid and large cap businesses have better economies of scale, or better access to cheaper debt, or something else?

The Mag 7 were weighted to make up 23% of the S&P 500 and around 47% in the Nasdaq. 

I'd be curious how the middle 20% of the 500 are doing with that much concentration. 

Aside from that, 500 are also analyzed forwards, backwards, and sideways.  They're far more likely to be priced efficiently at fair value more often than not, or potentially overvalued, because of all of the attention they get.  Of course not 100% of the time, but often enough.  As an amateur, I get enough of them by indexing in my retirement accounts. 

The 5000' view is simple.  Index weighting grossly favors those mega-cap stocks.  Most of which are further concentrated into Tech.  Which are, simply put, having an awesome run.   

Small caps, I believe offer a far greater opportunity of being underpriced, frequently offering a good potential on margin of safety.  Does it carry more risk?  Define risk for me first, then I can give an opinion.  

Looking at underperformance relative to the S&P over the past few years, no argument.  Small Cap has underperformed.  The instabilities of the pandemic, supply chain snarls, and inflation have been... interesting.  Okay, difficult to weigh in the short term.  However, we're not in it for the short view.  If we look out 15, 20, 30 years, and the underperformance gap closes considerably between small and large caps."

• Yes, I am happy with my returns so far. Despite a few really dumb mistakes I’ve managed to generate some alpha over the past few years and have hopefully set myself up for outsized returns in the future by buying low in the bear market. Loads of people on reddit will say it’s impossible to beat indices over long periods of time. This simply isn’t true. Investing has also been a way for me to learn a ton about the economy, the world at large, specific industries, human nature, etc. etc. Overall a very rewarding experience.

• It’s not realistic to get 15% returns every year. Annualized, maybe, but there will be drawdowns that bring great stock picks down with them. And you may have to watch bad stock picks outperform you in the short term! Even Buffett and Munger had bad years, and it wasn’t because they bought bad businesses. 

• My experience so far suggests becoming a great investor is a lifelong endeavor. But just in terms of getting going, after a couple years I feel I’m finally starting to find my niche in micro and small caps.

• Definitely learn the basic valuation methods and price ratios before buying. But truth be told, these are not as simple as they seem at first glance because of accounting practices and industry-specific quirks. At some point you have to just dive in and make the mistakes. Start with a small amount of money and learn as you go.

During the call in the same 2018, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.  
  
And just in two months Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.  
  
This was the reason of several big scandals and lawsuits based on the Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).  
  
So, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because yesterday, news reported that Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing), so if you were one of those damaged investors, you can [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

1136,Australian Vanadium produces first battery-ready high-purity vanadium electrolyte,2024-03-19 06:44:45,61.0,"Australian Vanadium Limited announced the successful commissioning of its vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility, culminating in producing its inaugural batch of high-purity vanadium electrolyte, primed for integration into vanadium flow batteries (VFBs).

This achievement follows the completion of the Facility’s construction in December 2023 and its official inauguration by Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King on 17 January 2024.

Independent analysis of the vanadium electrolyte underscores its quality, with impurities well within the limits expected by vanadium flow battery manufacturers, the company said in an ASX announcement.


Graham Arvidson, CEO of AVL, remarked on the significance of this accomplishment, stating, “The completion of the facility, coupled with the confirmation of the production of on-specification vanadium electrolyte from Western Australia’s first manufacturing facility, achieves another major milestone for AVL and is a positive reflection of the technical and operational expertise within our organisation.”

He added, “We are ready to accept orders for electrolyte and are actively pursuing sales.”

According to AVL, vanadium electrolyte serves as a critical component in vanadium flow batteries, renowned for their suitability in large-scale energy storage applications, particularly for electrical grids.

These batteries offer high energy storage capacity and extended cycle life, making them ideal for repeated charging and discharging without significant degradation.

VSUN Energy Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of AVL, is spearheading the establishment of a long duration energy storage pilot for Horizon Power in Kununurra, Western Australia.

This initiative underscores the potential for utilising vanadium electrolyte produced by the Facility to address Australia’s long-duration energy storage needs with high local content solutions.

The facility’s establishment aligns with AVL’s commitment to supporting Australia’s long-term carbon emission reduction plans. Federal government assistance in the form of a $3.69 million Australian Government Modern Manufacturing Translation grant facilitated the construction of the Facility.

Located in Wangara, Perth, the Facility is designed to produce high-purity electrolyte supporting up to 33 MWh per year of VFB energy storage, with provisions for easy expansion.

AVL employs proven electrolyte manufacturing technology licensed exclusively from U.S. Vanadium LLC (USV) in Australia and New Zealand. Vanadium oxides required for electrolyte production are currently supplied by USV.

Upon the commencement of production at the Australian Vanadium Project, AVL aims to provide comprehensive ‘pit to battery’ downstream value addition by generating vanadium concentrate at the mine site for processing into vanadium pentoxide, the feedstock for the Facility.

Samples of vanadium electrolyte produced at the Facility will undergo formal qualification by manufacturers of vanadium flow batteries.

Post-qualification, AVL anticipates commercial production of vanadium electrolyte to meet market demand, further cementing its position as a trusted supplier in the burgeoning energy storage industry.","['an', 'on', 'well', 'up', 'He', 'Post', 'form', 'are', 'ASX', 'site', 'for', 'life', 'by', 'Pty']",,

Do low P/E stocks fare better or they depreciate similarly to high P/E stocks? Thinking in terms of what will happen to my low P/E portfolio once the market reallocates away from overvalued tech stocks.

Update: Thank you very much for your insights. To investigate this matter further, I've plotted 409 companies, constituents of S&P 500 on 2007-01-01 which I assume is a ""pre-crash date."" I have then assumed the GFC has bottomed out at 2009-03-09, and derived P/E and close data for the reporting quarter closest to these dates. This figure plots pre-crash P/E vs drawdown where drawdown is the bottom close divided by pre-crash close, e.g. 0.5 means that at the bottom the stock was 50% of its pre-crash value.

Yet this is impossible to derive from a P/E ratio.

What a low P/E ratio actually shows is the market telling you that one (or more) of the following is true:

1. There is no confidence in the company to grow its earnings, or worse, it is pricing in a decline in earnings. For this reason it's very common for cyclical companies with high one-off earnings to ""look cheap"" when this is your main metric.
2. The company is struggling to convert earnings to cash flow which can be returned to investors. Examples are companies that require massive maintenance capex to maintain a stable level of earnings. If a company earns a stable $100 per share but needs to reinvest $80 just to keep up it should be priced far cheaper than a company which only needs to reinvest $20 to do the same. It is why e.g., car companies should always trade at a lower multiple  than e.g., software companies at the same level of earnings. That does not make one cheaper than the other.
3. There are higher risks involved with regards to future cashflows not materialising. These can include high company leverage (debt) and other idiosyncratic risks, but also geopolitical risk, policy risks etc.

Adobe then dropped like 20%. So I think when you buy great companies at low pes, they’ll go back to high pes cause they’re great, then you sell a bit cause they are overweight and could drop heavy.

The main concern I have for high PE stocks in a crash is that the investment thesis more often than not relies on high growth expectations which, in a crash, is often nonexistant, completely ruining the value thesis IMO.

On the other hand ppl dont usually invest in low PE stocks for growth (can be asset play, turnarounds etc). Plenty of low PE stocks have lesser moat as youve said, but plenty of high PE startups also suffers from this on the tangible assets side. Hence why I kinda disagree that low PE is a great determinant. A lot of these companies can have a quite significant moat on the balance sheet vs market cap side (low PBV, debt, high cash) or is in such a boring industry that the industry barely budged in a crash (inferior goods, anyone?)."

Toll brothers is a wonderful shareholder oriented homebuilder in the USA. Toll brothers focus is on luxury homes and they are represented all over the USA. They build and design together with the customers or sell already finished villas, I believe that even if there might be fluctuations in demand and supply ratio, this business can still be profitable for a long time. In addition, I know some of you may not want to get into the homebuilder business because of the housing crash in 2008, I understand those concerns but Toll Brothers is in a good position here, they have a low debt balance sheet with a debt to ebit ratio of 1.5 and also carry a little bit money so in a crisis they can certainly take on more debt and survive the crisis. Another positive point is the track record of TOL the last 10 years they had an average revenue growth of 16%, earnings growth of 29%, and EPS growth of 34% even in good times this is really impressive. As we can see from the boosted EPS growth the company has to buy back a lot of shares and yes they do the team is extremely shareholder friendly and they buy back on average 5% of the shares in a year you have to remember such companies are normally traded at a P/E multiple of 20 or higher, TOL is at a P/E of 12, let's say TOL's EPS grows by 10% in the next three years and the multiple rises to 14 then we would already be at a double.

TOL plays more in the luxury segment than the others which is why I wanted them included. I believe TOL was slower to land optioning than the others, which is why they lagged previously, but this has picked up in the last 5 years.

It's also interesting looking at their ""side ventures"", which have all taken slightly different directions. DHI invested in Forester, Lennar has a Lennar Ventures arm, and Toll has several Joint Ventures creating luxury rental communities. These increased the appeal for me compared to other home builders.

I believe the home builders still have a multi-year runway. Since they all do land optioning I believe interest rate risk is reduced compared to before, and they have levers to succeed in high or low interest rate environments. They aren't a huge investment for me, but I feel confident in those 3. They all have great management that values shareholders, low multiples, and good growth ahead IMO."

The total IQVIA market size for their ANDAs is over $9 billion. The IQVIA market data was provided by the company at the time of the press release saying the ANDA was accepted by the FDA and they might be a little skewed. One of the drugs had over a $5 billion IQVIA market size and was described in the PR as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulate. It is highly probable that their CNS stimulate is generic Vyvanse. If that is the case you could probably reduce that $5 billion by about 50-80% (or more) since there are now over 10 competitors for generic Vyvanse since that PR. I still think approval for a generic Vyvanse would still be a really big deal since their current largest selling drug is also a CNS stimulant (generic Adderall). 

Another one of the drugs is generic oxytocin. The company is in a patent lawsuit with Perdue. According to their last CC they filed a Paragraph IV certificate with their OxyContin ANDA. It’s my understanding that this type of ANDA filing involves a patent challenge and if they win they would technically be eligible to receive 180 day first to file exclusivity for generic OxyContin. I personally think right now first to file generic OxyContin is a more fare off scenario there are still a lot of companies in the running for first to file. But if it were to get it then it would be huge. That being said even without 180 day exclusivity generic OxyContin would still be a big deal.

1362,British American Tobacco: down the rabbit hole,2024-03-17 18:15:38,72.0,"Hey guys!

In a brief analysis shared here a few months ago, I highlighted British American Tobacco (BAT) as a potential investment opportunity. My research then went on as I delved into their extensive reports and sought feedback from individuals possessing deeper expertise in this domain.

  
The following one-pager summarizes the key takeaways and welcomes your insights. As the previous intro remains effective, I'll be using it again.  


  
**The best opportunities are to be found in bear markets**  
Sooner or later, regardless of how exceptional they are, companies find themselves in the midst of multi-year downturns. It happened to Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Microsoft, and Apple, just to name a few.  
The only time British American Tobacco has been cheaper than today was at the end of the largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history, which resulted in the tobacco companies paying the states and territories billions of dollars in yearly installments. Fast forward 17 years, and the stock had appreciated fifteen-fold, while paying out hefty dividends.  


  
**Main Positive Key Factors:**  
**1.	Market Dominance and Pricing Power:** The oligopolistic nature of tobacco markets gives them significant pricing power, especially since demand for their products is relatively inelastic, resulting in inordinate profitability and robust cash flows.  
**2.	Product Diversification:** BAT is successfully countering the decline in tobacco use rates through the diversification of its product portfolio. Vuse is the global market leader in Vapour, a category that is the fastest growing alternative to smoking. During FY23, the brand generated £1.8 billion in revenue (up 26.9% vs FY22) and accounted for 6.6% of BAT’s revenue. Furthermore, it has a value share of 36.1% in key Vapour markets (i.e. the Top 5 markets by industry revenue in tracked channels, being the U.S., the UK, France, Germany).  
**3.	Strong Free Cash Flow Yield:** During FY23, BAT generated free cash flow of £8.36 billion on revenue of £27.28 billion. At the current market capitalization of £52.34 billion, it is trading for a Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield of 16%.  
**4.	Stake Ownership in ITC Limited:** BAT owns more than 25% (worth currently about £12 billion) of the Indian multinational conglomerate ITC Limited.  
**5.	Financial Strength:** BATS maintains a healthy financial position with £2.76 billion in cash (technically £4.66 billion, but £1.90 billion of this is restricted cash held in ITCAN) and, as per the latest available financial report, an adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.6x. Additionally, the current rating is Baa2 (positive outlook), BBB+ (negative outlook), BBB (positive outlook), from Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively.  
**6.	Potential for Multiple Expansion:** The current P/FCF is about 5, and despite significant challenges such as declining cigarette sales, the shift to non-combustibles and regulatory concerns, a multiple expansion is not completely out of the question. In 2000, the company traded at just 7x earnings before eventually returning to its historical norm of 13 to 14x).  


  
**Main Negative Key Factors:**  
**1.	U.S. Regulatory Risk:** Although the FDA's proposed ban on menthol-flavoured cigarettes and all flavoured cigars presents a considerable threat to BAT's sales, even in the worst-case scenario, the company's current valuation remains appealing. In fact, the market estimates that the company's significant exposure to menthol cigarettes accounts for approximately 25% of its profits, and even under the assumption that every customer either quits smoking or switches to a competitor, BAT would still be trading for a FCF Yield of 12%.  
**2.	ITCAN:** In Canada, following the implementation of legislation enabling provincial governments to recover healthcare costs directly from tobacco manufacturers, ten provinces initiated actions to recover healthcare expenses associated with treating smoking-related illnesses as well as environmental tobacco smoke. The damages quantified in each of the provinces range between £5.9 billion £70 billion, and the province of Ontario delivered an expert report quantifying its damages in the range £167 billion £375 billion in 2016/2017 dollars.  
Unlike the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement from the late 90s though, where evidence linking smoking to health problems was becoming increasingly clear, today's awareness of the risks associated with smoking places greater emphasis on individual accountability. And in any case, whatever the outcome, it is reasonable to expect this turmoil to be of substantially smaller magnitude than the MSA, since smoking rates in Canada over the last few decades have been nowhere near as high as those in the US during the 1980s and 1990s.  
**3.	Other:** While there are certainly other factors fueling the negative market sentiment surrounding the company, such as declining smoking rates, deconsolidation-related issues, and uncertainties surrounding the shift towards Next Generation Products (NGP), I believe these are not particularly worrisome as things currently stand.  


  
**Seizing the Opportunity: Concluding Thoughts**  
BAT demonstrates strong market dominance, pricing power, and potential for multiple expansion. All things considered, the balance between risk and reward leans towards the latter, with BAT's diversified product portfolio, strategic investments, and financial resilience favourably positioning it for sustained success.

“Selling is increasingly a long shot
Take TikTok. Even if ByteDance puts the app up for sale, the Chinese government is unlikely to allow the company’s most valuable asset, its recommendation algorithm, to be included. The country introduced new export control rules for technologies like that algorithm in 2020, just as TikTok was nearing a deal with US buyers (which eventually fell apart).”

TikTok's privacy page admits to collecting as much data as possible, from meta data, GPS location, and pulls all contact information on someone's Facebook and instagram (if connected) and phone, while allowing themselves to use this data for whatever they want.

TikTok is ban from US Navy mobile devices, as it's been declared a cybersecurity threat.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/21/us-navy-bans-tiktok-from-mobile-devices-saying-its-a-cybersecurity-threat

TikTok had vulnerabilities as recent as last month, which allowed attackers to gain control of users accounts to upload videos or view private videos, while a separate flaw allowed attackers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the company’s website.

Its almost as if Tiktok is China’s attempt at pushing their propaganda out to the world while also having massive privacy issues. China has realized that to control the global population you have to control social media and what people see. So for the last year they have been pouring a ton of money into getting their social media app to be accepted and widely used- through a campaign of paid content creation/submission, and vote manipulation. Once they have widescale buy in, their backdoor monitoring and data collection will have free reign."

1399,I think ford is undervalued and it should be bigger than Tesla ,2024-03-19 03:10:11,74.0,"Ford compared to the s&p500

Ford has underperformed compared to the S&P 500 because its returns have been consistently below 10% annually, while the S&P 500 has returned over 10%. This underperformance can be assessed using financial ratios such as the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio (P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings per Share), Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio (P/B Ratio = Stock Price / Book Value per Share), and Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio (EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). Possible reasons for Ford's underperformance include company-specific challenges, industry dynamics, market sentiment, and broader economic factors .

Let's calculate its enterprise value (EV) 

Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash - Minority Interest

Given:
- Market Cap = $47.92 billion
- Total Debt = $149.23 billion
- Cash = $40.171 billion
- Minority Interest = $45 million

With the provided data:
- EV/EBITDA Ratio: Approximately 8.52
- EBITDA: Approximately $18.547 billion

Even without being bigger than Tesla it should at least be over 100 billion cap and over 25 per share ","['has', 'ford', 'Ford', 'Cash', 'be', 'it', 'for', 'can']",,

Yes their EV game is crap. However it's a fractional share of their revenue. Most of it comes from trucks, SUVs, and includes commercial trucks. 

A few metrics DO show some slight valuation, if you don't look at debt. And I don't think the price really is reflecting any sentiment towards that debt. Its mostly around poor EV performance and people assuming they have little growth. 

They will continue stable truck/SUV sales, so I don't see it dipping low, but really not foreseeing much uptick"

Bad: because of what I said above.   
Good: you know it will not go bankrupt because the Ford Family does not want to lose. They will do everything in their power to keep the company of going bankrupt just like they did in 2009. 

With a good product mix and higher quality, we could see the stock going back to $18-$20. (remember it was $25 two years ago). I think current fair market value should be around $16 (it hit $13 just few weeks ago). Comparing Ford to Tesla is not fair. Tesla does not have the baggage that Ford has (e.g. employee pension)."

I also think phasing out their compact market (Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus) is a gigantic mistake. Killing off Mercury may have also been a mistake because that was a chance to at least experiment with things.

So, all in all. I would say that yes Ford is undervalued compared to TSLA.

But I think it is going to take some time before Ford starts picking up momentum. If they can continue that juicy dividend for a few years and improve their balance sheet then it is definitely going to rise.

Idk. Ford is priced so bizarrely. It just seems stuck at its current valuation, like the market wants to see more first.

Their product is still good and they are still the leading manufacturer of trucks. 

I see tremendous upside, especially as the US continues decoupling from China. We are going to rely more and more on US manufacturing.

Bill Ackman is fighting a losing battle against Bill Ackman. Impostors posing as the billionaire hedge-fund manager on Facebook keep luring hapless investors into stock-market scams—and the real Ackman has been powerless to stop them.

Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has found more than 90 different ads impersonating him. Many of the ads remained visible for weeks after the company flagged them to Facebook, said Pershing Square spokesman Fran McGill. One ad promised annual returns of 125%, another a 25% return in a week and told victims to “hold these three stocks and you’ll be a millionaire.”

Bourget said the W****  group texts “all sounded very legit at first and they put a lot of effort into building your confidence, you think it’s part of an investment club and they have in-depth market analysis.” Some of the scammers in the group encouraged victims to “liquidate their 401ks, mortgage their homes, borrow from friends” in hopes of doubling their money on the group’s stock picks.

He lost half his savings on penny stocks on the Hong Kong exchange, but kept in touch with the group leaders because they had promised to cover 80% of the losses. When he learned this would require more trades, he declined.

The Hong Kong stock losses resulted from an apparent pump-and-dump scheme. In such scams, perpetrators increase the price of a penny stock by orchestrating purchases by the victims and then sell the stock, profiting at the victims’ expense.

Josh Kons, an investor lawyer in Hartford, Conn., who represents a Nashville couple who lost $1.3 million, said that in hindsight, it is clear that no more than a handful of the roughly 30 members of their WhatsApp group were real people.

It is about trying to extract future performance, but without making any express predictions about the future.

Simply saying that, for example, tech stocks are expensive as they trade at very high multiples, and therefore I will not overexpose myself to tech. 

Data does suggest that this seemingly simple approach of buying stocks at good prices relative to fundamentals does produce good long term results, and vice versa.

There is no need to try and estimate their future cashflows beyond what the market has already estimated and is implicit in their valuation. 

Your views are reminiscent of Damodoran who believes investors should use DCF to try and calculate present value for their company, even if they know the future is uncertain. 

And this where I disgaree because whatever value you get out will depend what you put in. So he bought TSLA at $180/40x earnings. In order to make that work, you need to plug in some magic which suggests they are more than just a car company, or that their earnings will grow very strongly in the not too distant future. If you plug in the magic you'll hit the valuation. If you don't you'll conclude it is still severely overpriced. So what have you learned? Nothing"

Those who think free cash flow cannot be manipulated clearly didn't study enough accounting because an intro to accounting class is hardly enough to understand every line and the intricacies of every ifrs. This is why multiples should always be taken with a grain of salt, because multiples can be heavily manipulated and not comparable across different companies due to differences of norms applications. Furthermore, you can't even compare the same company to its historical financials 5 to 10 years ago because there's been changes in accounting norms across time. So unless you know how to normalize all of the problems stated above, simply comparing multiples proves absolutely... nothing."

Thanks for understanding my point lol.

It seems a lot of people believe value investing must be active, that you must use individual stock selection to achieve alpha, but you can also generate alpha (vs market cap) using methodical, passive strategies. 

Some people seem to see a conflict between what I am talking about and what Graham was originally talking about, but value as a factor is only an extension of his original ideas. He intuited things which research performed since has validated. And the advent of ETFs has made it possible for investors to implement value strategies cheaply. I wonder what he himself would think of it if he was around today.

I am doing both passive and active. I use a value ETF as my core holding and I'm picking stocks on the side - I might go more active if I become convinced my selection is good, but we'll see."

Theoretically the value factor should work across many measures, but some will prove better than others, and usually it's a weighting of multiple measures that people use

It's just a fundamentally different approach to investing than you are discussing, top down vs bottom-up. Basically the difference is that value investing with factor investing doesn't assume you have any special ability to determine value relative to the aggregate market, running the same DCF models everyone else is. Its focus is pairing down the universe of stocks to those with higher expected returns(no free lunch, those also have higher risk)."

High valuation ratios imply an expectation of above market cf growth, not that that company is “over” valued.  Buyers that don’t believe in that growth believe that that investment is “overvalued” - hence one cannot invest without being forward looking because if your preferred metric signals “over” valued really it is just signaling that other investors have a view that growth will be higher than whatever is inherently baked into the cutoff value of your metric.

If everyone can choose where to invest, dollars flow from “over” valued to “under” valued.  Those dollars may flow by one of many valuation approaches.  If some of those people are using dcf, then dcf is a factor in today’s pricing.

If you truly believe that one cannot predict the future any better than the market, then you are a boglehead, and should not be investing in individual companies.  Instead the rational conclusion of that viewpoint is buy an index.

I’ve bought and sold in metrics and dcf.  Every time I buy or sell an investment it is because of my view about what will happens between now and some future date.  That’s inescapable as investing return is literally change between now and later.

So whether it be metric, dcf, or a feeling - they are all predictions about the future."

Blackrock make the following comment:

> Value, like all factors we believe in, has an economic rationale for why it has existed historically and why we expect it to persist going forward. Value is the result of a reward for bearing risk that other investors are not willing to take (value companies can be riskier than their counterparts). Value companies have been shown to trade at a larger discount than their growth-focused peers. Further, value exists to due to investor behavioral biases such as overpaying for past growth.

> Value factor strategies specifically focus on identifying companies that may be undervalued. All else equal, if two companies generate the same profits or the same book value, we prefer to buy the one that is less expensive. The company that has the lower valuation has higher expected returns.

Edit: Or if you meant why is EV/CFO the strongest predictor of returns, probably because it accounts for debt, and at the same time ignores 'technical accounting operations' like depreciation and amortising intangible assets."

Eh I don't think this is true necessarily. This is because the market return is the optimal for the aggregate investor, but an individual may differ from the aggregate. Thus, one's ideal portfolio is not necessarily the market portfolio, and thus their expected return is not necessarily the market return. This is not incompatible with the EMH, it's the basis of factor investing. 

One can invest in the value factor to gain higher expected return, but will also have higher risk. This can be seen in the history of value factor stock performance, with higher volatility and long periods of underperformance."

I have actually asked the Bogleheads if it would be acceptable to track an alternative index than market cap and received a fairly clear 'no'. So I am out of that community.

However, I do believe that using a largely passive strategy is completely valid, and in many ways (costs, taxes) desirable, which might be causing you to mistake me for a Boglehead.

I don't see why value must be an active strategy, and the chart I posted in the OP demonstrates that even seemingly simple, methodical, passive selection methods can lead to good results. (There is a ton of other research showing this too)

And FWIW - I am doing some active selection as well. Currently 10% of portfolio. The rest is passive. I am not adverse to active per se, but I'd need to convince myself I can actually, really, do it, taking into account all costs, before I expand"

The exercise of preparing a cf forecast should force the practitioner to think deeply about comes of possibility into the future, which is a deeper form of due diligence.

**summary**

petrotal was formed after taking over gran tiera's assets in peru. the company has been producing oil since 2018 and has grown in to the largest peruvian oil company today. The company has had a couple of harder year since they had to deal with covid at the start of their business but they are doing better then most companies. The company operates 1 field (brentena) which was left for dead by gran tiera. there is still a second block and some prospects on the same block as bretena.

&#x200B;

**Peru's oil industry**

Peru's oil industry doenst have a lot of major oil producers and is better known for its copper mines but dont get fooled. Peru had a major oil industry and its gas industry is still thriving but today its production is around the 45kbpd (depended on the season) this is very low compaired to neighbouring countries. like brazil or equador. 

peru has a national oil company called petroperu who is desperate to revive its oil industry to its former glory. The country has a couple of near term development projects or even revive projects that are intressting for companies like petrotal.

peru's permitting is realy slow and it takes a long time to develop projects. 

the size of peru's oil industry and the slow permitting makes it unintressting for large players to come in and invest in to the country.

&#x200B;

**Assets**

petrotal holds 2 blocks in peru. block 95 and block 107.

block 95 is the block that holds brentena. The oil field hold around 200 million barrels (3p) and the resource has been upgraded several times even when producing. The production of bretena has been growing every year and is suppose grow further until 2028. even during covid petrotal was able to grow its production in double digit %.

production in 2023 was around 14kbpd and 2024 should be around 17kbpd which shows its incredible growth. peak production should be around the 31kbpd level in 2028.

even though brentena is growing fast the field produces a lot of FCF. q3 is their worst quarter but they were still able to produce 37 million of fcf.

The biggest hold back to petrotal are the export routes. Since they transport their oil by river it is heavly dependent on the seasons. there are plans to transport it through a pipeline that is owned by petroperu. 

block 95 holds a couple other prospects that are just as potential as brentena. the company is preparing to drill these prospects in 2026 and early exploration is set in h2 this year. possible 4 fields off this size.

block 107 is a little closer and has a drilling target for 2025 if they can find a partner. the block is said to hold 662 million barrels of oil which is at least twice the size of brentena.

&#x200B;

**Understaning the field**

  
the wells drilled in to brentena produce most oil in the first couple of months. a normal production profile looks like.

  
month 1 8000 bopd  
month 2 5000 bopd  
month 3 3500 bopd.

  
the production goes down  to 2000 eoy and the year after it goes to 1000 where it stays flat for years. the field isnt that old and it is suggested that the well will produce at the 1000 level for 20 years since the start of production. (this isnt yet proven since the field hasnt produced for 20 years)  


this does mean that the irr look realy good  since your can get your investment back in 1-3 months and dont realy have to add a lot more capitail and you can recylce the same money for a while.  
You also have have the benefit of years worth of production al though at a lower level.

&#x200B;

**Value**

petrotal market cap is 542 million today. the company has a net cash of 90 million usd (31-12-2023) or an enterprise value of 450 million.

If you are trying to value a resource company it is normal to use the npv model for their assets. oil companies hold 4 of these values. pdp, p1,p2,p3. most companies today are valued in between p1-p2 value.

PDP is the lowest and petrotal is priced a little below this value (31-12-2023). since the value of pdp has been set petrotal has drilled 1 new well and is drilling another well that is suppose to produce in a couple of days/ weeks. meaning that his value is already significantly higher.

the p1 value of petrotal stands at 888 million or almost 100% upside based on current enterprise value.

the p2  and p3 value stand at 1,65b and 2,5b. I personaly like the p1 value the best because the company is a little riskier that a american/canadian oil co.

i know some investors like the pe ratio. The pe ratio stands at little over 5 based on market cap and q3 numbers. 

a pe of 5 seems average but this is based on their worst quarter and around 15% of their market cap is just cash. if you base it on their best quarter and include cash the pe is around 3.

&#x200B;

**Why pick petrotal**

if a canadian/american oil company is safer as an investment why not just pick those?                              petrotal is one of the few companies that still has cheap oil. there are few companies that can survive 60 dollar oil and petrotal can thrive in that. an average canadian oil co needs to go in survival mode for that type of industry and many could go bankrupt.

operating expenses for the us and canada are around 30 usd and if its a realy good one 20. petrotal stands at 4-6.  (still looking to cut cost)

the returns on investment are also realy high for petrotal an investment has a payback of less the 3 months. (some cases 1,5 months) while the well produces for years. The well do produce a lot of oil in the first 3 months and then decline to a low level where it stays stable for years.

&#x200B;

**Dividends/buybacks**

Petrotal offers a varible dividend and a base dividend combined the company offers an almost 20% payout mostly in the for of dividends.

buybacks are unlikley to increase because petrotal share arent traded that much and the tsx has some restrictions on buybacks.

for a share of around ,75 cad  petrotal offers a 8 cent usd dividend based on their last payment. annualized.

petrotal doesnt have any debt and the company want to payout any cash it gets above the 65 million.

petrotal has said they will be able to maintain a 66 million payout until 2042 and have 2 billion left form other investments of brentena alone.

**Risks**

peru isnt a safe juristicion compaired to the us or eu but isnt problematic enough to be uninvestable. 

petrotal has dealt with the issues of this country. production issues because of a protest cause 6 days of production delays for the company.

Peru used to have a gang that cut the pipelines of the state owned company so they could get paid to fix them. they have been arrested but still. petrotal is looking to use the pipeline in the dry season.

petrotal moves all their oil by boat which means that during a dry season they need to shut in half of their production (q3 mostly) the company has been looking for additional export routes.

&#x200B;

given these risky i dont think it is fair to give petrotal the normal valueation but i think a 1 p value should be possible of a company like this.

&#x200B;

**opportunity's** 

petrotal is the largest company in peru and they're invited to all bidings on new blocks. currently there is 1 blocks that is highly potential for petrotal to win. 1 is a block that is already producing 10kbpd but the petroperu believes that with the right investments it could double. the bidding is starting and will be awared in may. 

there is a second second block where petrotal has said to be intrested in but it isnt producing a signficant amouth but still intressting for the future

also the reopening for the pipeline which is planned for this year would be end all export issues.

the company is also looking to cut export cost and has severval trails running.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

petrotal has massive share price upside potential with their current assets next to a 12% stable dividend and 5%\~ variable.

the company has 100% growth potential in their current field and 4 other field of the same size on their current block. (95) aswell as a massive project on block 107. and some inorganic opportunity's

The company is a little more risky then your us/ca oil co but the growth potential and returns are incompairable.

personaly i dont like us/ca small caps because of the high break-evens compaired to a major.

i hope some of you look at the company for yourself. The ceo is also the founder of the company and is a peruvain nation and has worked for the oil industry there his whole life. He does do a lot of interviews and is a major shareholder in the company.

I don’t like their inventory profile. While Bretana looks decently proved up, Block 107 has been in need of a farm-in partner for several years, and PetroTal hasn’t found one. It is way out of the way of more developed-out areas. I assign zero value to this prospect. 

The other prospects PetroTal boasts within Block 95 are also very unproven and remote. It’s quite telling that facility & infrastructure costs are as expensive as the wells themselves. The block is up against protected natural areas, so I sincerely doubt that Peru would award PetroTal permits to develop all of the unproven areas further south. That “Lead E” is basically nothing more than made up numbers in a computer. 

Because PetroTal is so lightly capitalized, this firm will always be a bad exploration well away from falling apart. The Bretana field has maybe a 2-5 year reserve life left, meaning that these exploration wells further south need to hit good pay dirt in the Vivian sand. And that brings about not only reservoir risk (is the sand as oil-rich down here vs in the Bretana field?), but also execution risk (can they develop a $13-$20 million well targeting a pay zone of only 50-100 feet?). Another key risk of the Vivian sand is that, below that stratigraphic layer lies a large aquifer. A poorly completed well (even with AICD valves used) means that PetroTal could just be drilling a really expensive water well that produces almost no oil. I’d be less concerned with “dry holes” and much more concerned about “water holes” here. 

The dividend is not that secure. PetroTal earns about $4 in free cash per produced barrel, and they distribute $10/Bbl in dividends and buybacks. So they’re paying out over double their free cash in investor servicing. I’d say a 10% yield doesn’t reflect that risk. 

To your point about 1P reserve value exceeding PetroTal’s current market cap, that’s because their current 1P reserves, if fully developed successfully, wouldn’t be enough to grow production. They have to develop those unproven Bretana wells just to grow production. And, while they are not too far from existing productive wells, they still carry heavy operational risk. They can’t afford to blow a well in Bretana. If they do, forget about dividends."

- I am not sure their earnings profile is very stable. They have seen explosive earnings growth with very high profits. This makes me question sustainability. And if sustainability is questioned that makes me wonder how good their valuation really is.

When they do well they become very attractive to politicians, and also the idea of nationalising successful oil companies sits well with the public. I am not familiar with Peru so this might be unfair

- The reason I am not looking any further into it is I can get cheap EU energy stocks with low multiples, low debt, well established, much less political risk and stronger investor protections. See for example PKN, MOL, OMV, but also the majors SHELL, BP., TTE.

They guide to $36 million of Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) for FY 2024. Divide that amount by 17,000 Bbls/d, and you come out to about $5.80/Bbl after all sales, deducts, operating costs, capex, and working capital adjustments have been accounted for. That is what I care about more than anything else. To maintain a $0.015/share base dividend on their 916,7 million outstanding shares, they would need to pay $55 million, so before even accounting for buybacks, they're going to have to pay out more than they organically generate. Variable dividends aren't happening in this scenario, and I doubt they'll buy back the full $11 million they've budgeted for.

Losing a $13-$20 million well has a *much* bigger impact than just one bad quarter. Not only do they lose the invested cash, they also lose future production growth. One lost well in 2024 would imply 2,300 Bbls/d of lost annualized production (using their NSAI 2P curve - IP365). That would imply a 13% production miss, and at least $33.5 million of lost annualized EBITDA (assuming they earn ~$40/Bbl in EBITDA...on par with their most recent Q). That would wipe out all of their distributable cash flow for the year, and put them in a really rough place going into 2025, when they're really going to have to start spending exploration money - $30 million, on top of the continued Bretana development program.

There are other elements of PetroTal that I don't like and haven't really gotten into as much - the first being the takeaway constraints without pipeline infrastructure, and the other being the very heavy, low-gravity crude that they produce."

The next best resource is, honestly, earnings reports and presentations from the US E&P producers. The best technical resource out there would be the Oilfield Glossary website run by SLB. Use it as a reference source when you come across an unfamiliar term or concept (like horizontal drilling or AICD valves). 

As far as my due diligence responses, honestly, a lot of that just comes from being in the industry for over 13 years. E&P companies incur a plethora of challenges when developing an oil / gas play. But usually, the process for an exploratory project like PetroTal’s involve:

1) Acquisition of acreage. Here, TAL’s leasing land from the Peruvian government. In the US Permian Basin, companies lease land and drilling rights from private land owners or companies. You have to pay a lot of upfront costs that won’t be recouped for several years - maybe even decades - here. 

2) Evaluation of the reservoir. This happens in tandem with step 1. E&P firms hire geologists and reservoir engineers to study where a particular potential oil-bearing region might be exploited for a reasonable upfront cost and exceptional return. PetroTal bought into Gran Tierra’s positions, so they did their homework on the leases and the underlying geology and determined that there was value to be had. 

3) Exploration of the reservoir. This involves 3D seismology, 2D well logs strung together, and detailed research of any past drilling efforts. If a region has a lot of successful drilling history (like the Permian Basin) then we can say that it’s a de-risked play. All the computers and simulations in the world don’t measure up to hard financial results, so the Block 95 and Block 107 plays are riskier for PetroTal because there’s very limited history to go off of. 

4) Development of the reservoir. By far the hardest thing to do. Thousands of variables factor into this step, and one misstep can ruin millions of dollars invested. It’s hard to really evaluate this as a newcomer unless you’ve seen failures firsthand and talked with people who were involved in it. But just know that this is where you evaluate whether a company’s going to make it big or go bust. 

5) Extraction & marketing of the commodity. A good operator has ample capacity to take oil or gas out of the wellhead and sell them into premium markets. PetroTel is in an awkward place in Peru. Very remote, near natural preservations, and far away from transport pipelines. That costs them a lot of money ($6-7 for every produced barrel) to move oil to its ultimate buyers. And apparently very weather dependent because low river levels prevent the transport barges from reaching PetroTal’s offload site, which caused production to fall significantly in Q3 2023. 

6) What’s Next. Eventually, the company will exhaust all the prospective drilling locations in a play and will run out of inventory. The wells will naturally deplete over time, and need to be replaced with other production sources in due time. That is one of the predicaments PetroTel is in now. The Bretana field has been very good for them, but it only has a few years left of really profitable development. They need another prospect to begin exploring, and that’s where the Block 107 and more southern Block 95 plays come into focus. Like Bretana, they’re remote, unexplored, and undeveloped. They’ll require billions of dollars in investment, assuming that their quantities are commercially viable. Investors like me see far higher risks with these opportunities and as such won’t assign much value to them in their current states."

1516,Motorola Solutions Valuation,2024-03-17 18:18:15,80.0,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to get an opinion on the intrinsic valuation of Motorola solutions (MSI), its growth potential and the size of their moat. If you haven't heard of the company, they essentially have a duopoly on radios, but they are also offering subscription based cloud security surveillance cameras. 

Their company details section is:

""""""  
Motorola Solutions, Inc. provides public safety and enterprise security. The Company offers safety and security technologies, which include land mobile radio communications (LMR), video security, and command center. Across technologies, it offers cloud-based and hybrid solutions, cybersecurity services, software and subscriptions services as well as managed and support services. Its segments include Products and Systems Integration, and Software and Services. The Products and Systems Integration segment offers a portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video security devices and infrastructure, and the implementation and integration of such systems, devices, and applications. The Company's Software and Services segment provides a range of solution offerings for government, public safety and commercial customers. Its Software includes public safety and enterprise Command Center, unified communications applications, certain mobile video equipment, and video software solutions.

""""""

I think this company has massive growth potential. It's a bit of an unethical stock, because you're betting on big brother winning out, however with the destabilisation of Europe and cities more generally across the western world, this technology is going to be in high demand.

There is also a largely untapped market of non-service people body worn cameras.

They are have unique market combination of the interplay between the radios and the video security.  


Through recent acquisitions they ere now able to offer cloud based security and access control. This migration hasn't fully occurred yet. They have also acquired halo sensors.  


Management seems on point.

I'm wondering if people think the stock is overpriced/what price they would buy or whether its just buy buy buy or sell sell sell.

Margins are higher too. And they likely have some nice tailwinds from growing civil unrest. But the valuation looks a bit high... although what stock isn't trading richly these days?

They're trading quite a bit above their historical averages, but maybe that's justified if they can grow their cloud-based subscription services? Still, analyst estimates (yeah, take with a grain of salt) are for high single digit EPS growth the next several years. Which isn't too bad, but for a stock trading at ~28x? 

I haven't done a deep dive on the company, wouldn't mind looking into it more when I get a chance, but at a glance I feel like sub $300 is a pretty good price, sub $275 would be a great price. That'd be a low 20s multiple based on forward earnings. 

While they don't overlap directly, Axon might be worth looking at too, just to compare. I'm not sure who else operates in this space, but it might be worth looking at the competition. I think Axon, for example, has stated they aren't interested in expanding into some of the areas that Motorola already operates in."

Kina Securities Limited holds Papua New Guinea’s second largest bank, Kina Bank Limited and also Kina Wealth Management. 

Kina Bank was founded in 1985, and IPO occurred in 2015.

Currently trading at PE 5.75, well under a 7 year average of 8.4 (I removed the first 2 years of high PEs as typical “IPO buzz” from my calculation, to be conservative).

Currently trading at price/book of .99 compared to a 1.26 7 year average.

18.14% ROE 5 year average.

Strong commitment by management to increasing dividends, although with payout ratios tending high. Currently trading at 11% dividend yield.

I wanted to highlight a company that has a super strong catalyst. If there are any doubts or any questions, by all means please ask. I would love to hear the bear case of this thesis.   
ZIM integrated shipping was once a cash cow. During the pandemic they were averaging near 4,000 to 5,000 a container and raked in billions per a year… Even giving out a colossal 25+ in dividends in 2022. This is no typo but in 2022 the company earned nearly 8 billion in cash on 12.56 billion in sales! Please, by all means check!   
We are in a what have you done for me lately society. Post pandemic people want instant gratification, instant gains. So now is the time to jump in on ZIM… Why?  
The last time ZIM paid a special dividend it was near this time last year, a 6.40 dividend. At that time they made 3.44 per share. \[Full year average container was 3,240\] but for the fourth quarter when they raked in cash the average was 2,122. The 4th quarter which was just reported the average rate was a dreadful 1,100! \[So you have an idea, pre pandemic, the rates were 1,600-1,900\] Fast forward to today, with the war… rates started to spike in December, I would have gladly bet that the average rate would have been much higher than the 1,139 for Q3, and when it ended up being 1,100 for the 4th quarter, that was pathetic. Stock deserved to be down…  
However, the guidance was very odd, I have read the earnings call 2x, questions were asked why the wide range..  
Well no one can predict war! I have checked spot rates since January 15th and I have attached photos of the 2 main sources used to check spot rates… The rates have hovered above 2,000 almost the entire quarter!  
Analysts as of Friday having ZIM lose 83 cents a share for the first quarter that ends March 31st… I would love to bet anyone anywhere that they will slam that by at least 25+ cents. I would not be surprised if they come in at a profit! Why? The new vessels are much more fuel efficient, costs are going down, on the balance sheet the debt is rising as the new vessels come into play. These newer ships will better the bottom lines! I do not know of the 2rd, 3rd of full year, as analysts tried several ways to ask during the call, but I know the first quarter will be a blow up!  
We have a big bonus! About 30 million shares are short of the 95 million float, or near 33%. Just because a company is short doesn’t mean it will squeeze.. however this catalyst of war, makes it very profitable….. It was asked on the call if they would be dividends if the company does indeed profit…. And it was answered that it was early to assume but that they have not changed the dividend policy 30% of profits!  
Happy Trading!

**My views on a few of the above names**

**AIG:** I've been an AIG bull for a long time, and it just made a 52-week high. I like the dividend and the strong EPS growth. My concern is the drop in revenue & net income last year and while the valuation is reasonable compared to the market overall, it's on the higher end for the sector on a P/E basis. Still, I remain bullish given the overall fundamentals & performance in recent years, and it remains one of the largest insurance companies. 

**GPK:** I like that this company, which is in the packaging industry, has started to create alternatives to plastic. This is neccessary to meet consumer demands and I believe regulatory requirements in the future. The balance sheet looks good, and the valuation is lower than that of the industry & market averages. 

**GM:** I am a bit conflicted as it comes to GM as a company. Personally, I dislike most of their vehicles and more specific to our purpose here, they have been losing marketshare. They've also been plaqued by cars with low reliabilty and scandals over the years. As we move towards more EVs, will they be able to rebrand themselves as a more reliable brand? I don't know. On the flip side, I do think they benefit from having some lower cost options relative to some of the Toyotas and Hondas out there. And people seem to love Chevy pickup trucks. I love the current valuation and the balance sheet looks good. EPS is slow. 

**UNM:** Like AIG, it just made a 52-week high. The valuation seems fair, EPS growth is solid, and the balance sheet is kind of a mixed-bag.","['or', 'BK', 'kind', 'On', 'be', 'OC', 'net', 'it', 'by', 'UNM', 'ACGL', 'out', 'APO', 'any', 'GM', 'has', 'ARMK', 'drop', 'see', 'do', 'bit', 'cost', 'an', 'for', 'WCC', 'love', 'PEG', 'move', 'cars', 'Arch', 'low', 'on', 'CF', 'MTB', 'GPK', 'AIG', 'good', 'am']",,

1605,Berkshire Bought Back About $2.3 Billion in Stock - Barron's on MSN,2024-03-15 23:12:02,87.0,"  
[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/berkshire-bought-back-about-23-billion-in-stock/ar-BB1jYwLc](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/berkshire-bought-back-about-23-billion-in-stock/ar-BB1jYwLc)   
  
Story by Andrew Bary  
  
Berkshire Hathaway bought back about $2.3 billion in stock in the first quarter through March 6, based on a Barron’s calculation from information in the company’s proxy statement released late Friday.  
  
The company repurchased about 3,800 Class A shares (with Class B stock buybacks converted to an equivalent amount of Class A shares) from year-end 2023 through March 6.  
  
The $2.3 billion of repurchases marks a pickup from the $2.2 billion of stock that Berkshire repurchased in the fourth quarter and could mean $3 billion or more of buybacks for the current quarter if the pace of repurchases continues at the rate of the first two months of the year.  
  
Most of the buybacks in the quarter occurred from Feb. 13 to March 6, with Barron’s estimating that total at around $1.7 billion with about $600 million repurchased in the first six weeks of the quarter.  
Investors watch the pace of Berkshire’s buybacks as an indication of whether Buffett views the stock as cheaply valued since he determines the pace of repurchases and has said repeatedly that he is price conscious.  
  
Berkshire stock has been strong this year with the Class A and B shares up about 14% against a roughly 7.5% total return for the S&P 500 index. The Class A stock finished Friday at $618,133, up 0.9%, while the Class B shares ended at $408.13, up 0.3%  
  
The proxy also discloses that Greg Abel, the likely successor to CEO Warren Buffett, earned just over $20 million in total compensation last year, up from $19 million in 2022.  
  
Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, heads the company’s vast non-insurance operations. Ajit Jain, who oversees the company’s insurance businesses, also earned just over $20 million last year. Buffett, who determines their pay, has compensated them equally since they were elevated to their current positions in 2018.  
  
Berkshire continues to operate differently from other big companies on executive pay.  
  
For starters, Buffett is paid a salary of $100,000 a year with no bonus—a level of compensation he has received for over 35 years. The proxy states that he doesn’t want an increase in pay.  
  
He may be the only major CEO who reimburses the company for minor items such as phone calls and postage that are personal in nature. He reimbursed Berkshire $50,000 for those incidental expenses in 2023, in keeping with payments in past years.  
  
Berkshire spent over $300,000 on Buffett’s personal security last year, which is counted as compensation. But that is a fraction of companies such as Meta Platforms spend on their CEO security.  
  
Buffett pays for his own personal jet travel on NetJets, a Berkhsire company, and the company doesn’t pay for cars or country club dues for executives.  
  
Buffett hates parting with Berkshire Hathaway stock, viewing every share as precious, and doesn’t grant stock compensation to executives or any employees. The company states emphatically in the proxy: “Berkshire never intends to use Berkshire stock in compensating employees.”  
  
Berkshire lets Buffett set the compensation for Abel and Jain, and the proxy states the factors Buffett uses “typically are subjective.” There are no incomprehensible formulas like there are at most public companies. And Berkshire doesn’t use compensation consultants in setting executive pay.  
  
Both Buffett and Charlie Munger, the Berkshire vice chairman who died at 99 in late 2023, dislike consultants of all kinds. Munger once said that he would rather “throw an asp down my shirt front” than hire one.  
  
Buffett once said that if Berkshire uses pay consultants after his death, he will rise from his grave in anger. Their view has been that companies use pay consultants to inflate executive compensation.","['or', 'up', 'pays', 'Back', 'msn', 'view', 'ar', 'he', 'be', 'an', 'for', 'by', 'For', 'back', 'www', 'rise', 'pay', 'cars', 'six', 'MSN', 'any', 'big', 'on', 'has', 'Both', 'He', 'all', 'Meta', 'are', 'two']",,

The big issue with buybacks is in aggregate and in general they are used at poor times.

Which does make sense but it still doesn't make any sense that buybacks happen the most when the stock is richly valued. 

What needs to happen in my opinion is we need to stop favoring buybacks over dividends in tax policy. Ultimately they are both returning funds to shareholders and so should be taxed at the same rate. And CEO and other exec compensation needs to be modified so that it's not simply about stock price appreciation but equally considers the various ways that value is returned to shareholders.

Only then will we get to the point we want to be at, where companies Will want to return money to shareholders when they don't have a high value used for it and will do so with buybacks when the stock is fairly valued and via dividends when it's richly valued."

Unless your effective capital gains tax is below 4%, it's still a much cheaper way to return capital to shareholders vs dividends, assuming the stock is at or below intrinsic value. And unlike dividends, the owners still get to choose when to pay the capital gains taxes.

Remember, if you have ordinary income, dividends have their own tax, PLUS they push your income into a higher tax bracket. A dollar of dividends might have a 15% tax  plus push a dollar of income from the 24% to 32% bracket, making the effective tax on that dividend 23%.

* Regulatory pressures globally will favor EV’s. Tesla is well suited to capture a lot of market and survive in the new landscape. Much still depends on Model 2. It’s a fallacy to think that the auto market is winner-take-all so reset expectations accordingly about market share; Tesla will lose out % wise but still continue to own a large slice of the growing pie …. enough to be a cash cow. 

* Tesla margins are now aligned with industry.  Future unlocking of margins depends on how well dry battery electrode can ramp and any incremental margins with manufacturing efficiencies *(“unboxed”, robotics, etc)*. Macroeconomically, there might be another bump in pricing premium in the scenario of dying legacy ICE (regulatory, otherwise) without competitive EV alternatives. 

* FSD and ultimately the moonshot of robotaxis?  Version 12 has been another jump in progress with change of training method.  I personally believe they have a data moat with training data/miles. 

* Moonshot of Optimus and AI-NNT-training as a service. Something Nvidia is interested in providing the *shovels* for. 

* Energy storage is growing but ultimately a commodity market longterm. *Can Tesla leverage Apple-like integrated ecosystem of hardware and software? - particularly for Utilities.*

* Able to convert and realize margins of Insurance? 

* Share buy backs likely to occur at some point with a stronger board of directors along with a Toyota-like marketing campaign.

There are sectors where demand increased drastically, yet the vast majority of companies failed to make money, airlines being a great example.

Toyota has been flat last several years and last year posted positive growth of about 7%.

I would rate cars in my own head based on tail light designs etc when I was younger. I’ve always had this weird obsession with vehicles. But not in a gear head way haha. 

I had money saved from the navy and decided to start looking into the company and investing in general. 

Tesla happened to be at a 52 week (multi year low) in May 2019 and I decided to buy shares. 

I used 1/6th of my savings to start a position. 

The ride has been wild. But I’m more excited about my investment than ever. To me this is a generational company. Younger kids go crazy and innately love teslas. 

Whether you like it or not it is the future. Doesn’t mean you can’t be a part of it. 

P.s. When long term (weekly chart) RSI gets close to oversold (<30) and/or goes below, that is the time to buy.

As I wrote in my [portfolio update post..](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1b8c8uo/portfolio_update_you_dont_need_big_tech_for_big/)

Cigarettes are on a decline, yes, but at a snails-pace. From 2019 to 2023 BTI cigarette sales have declined only about 3%. Meanwhile, alternative tobacco products like vaping have increased substantially. I believe the alternative tobacco products will not only replace lost cigarette revenue, but cause overall revenue to grow - at a snails pace, but still, it will grow. (Example: BTI Vapour products had 401mil in sales in 2019, and now it's at 1802mil).

The risk is that countries like the UK follow Australia (and Mexico..) in banning vapes. But there's a good chance they will only ban disposable vapes."

However yes, do ban disposable vapes because they are targeted at young people and the takeup rates are high.

What I find strange is the valuation gap between BTI and PM. So I know that PM have the better portfolio in many ways, less reliant on combustibles, ahead of the game on alternatives, but still, the gap is massive, and I think it also reflects the US-Europe valuation gap, whereby European equities are secularly undervalued vs US equities, even if they do most of their business in the US.

Factors are a bit contradictory when putting them together and trying to maximize overall factor exposure. For example: value is defined as low p/bv and quality is defined as high ROE or inverse of ROE would be bv/E, when you combine them you will literally get low P/E as p/bv * bv/E equals p/E. Similar is the momentum factor, you can't really expect companies that are trading at lower valuations to fly off your chart at the same time to be exposed to both value and momentum factors.


These factors usually explain different types of alpha, combining them doesn't really works in real world as factors are made to be contradictory to explain why different types of stocks outperform, for example, Nvidia would get into Quality + Momentum factors that would explain its outperformance. "

This mainly comes from the cyclical nature that is presented in each factor. Each factor may perform well or bad in its own time. As a result, factor timing becomes a problem, but we can not control it. So, instead of timing factors, we instead thoughtfully integrate complementary factors such as quality and value. Momentum is difficult to integrate and shouldn't be implemented together with value + quality integration. Studies also do recommend this. Take a look at these papers, ""Buffets alpha"" by Andrea frazzini. ""Quality investing"" by Robert norvy max, ""The other side of value, the gross profitability premium"" by Robert norvy max, and ""Factor investing and asset allocation book"" by Roger m stien.

The contradiction you pointed out has two problems.  Quality is associated with high ROE, not its inverse. The simplification to P/E assumes looking for low ROE, which is not the goal of quality investing.

Combining factors is about balance, not direct multiplication. For instance, we look for undervalued stocks (value factor) that demonstrate strong profitability, financial health, and quality management ( quality factor).

You can likely chase momentum on its own if you wish to be exposed to this. But I find momentum difficult to chase and riskier than other factors because it involves timing momentum.

Lastly, regarding ETF performance you mentioned. Most etfs available to the public are not multi factor etfs. If they are its only two factors such as size and value. Combining quality and value in an ETF isn't feasible for passive investing. This etf would never exist. It would be closer to a mutual fund. We know from available data that mutual funds fail to outperform the market after costs. You'd likely have to build your own portfolio that integrated these factors well. Else the etf would suffer integrating these factor exposures togother."

For example Europe enhanced value is well, high on value and yield, as you would expect, but also on low volatility, and maintains neutrality on quality, the achilles heel of low p/e stocks. The only thing it's slightly negative on is momentum which is fine by me.

If you look at the historic performance of US large cap value you'll see it has outperformed US large cap significantly and consistently, with the exception of the past 15 years, probably due to the very low interest rates which favour growth/long duration stocks. These stocks were only picked based on cheap multiples. And yet, that alone, appears to offer better risk-adjusted return.

For me both value as a factor and value in the buffet style are valid. The question is do you want to be active or passive? Is your selection really better, also considering the higher costs of actively managing? I am not sure if mine is, but 10% of my portfolio is active stock selection and I may increase that in future. I use a value ETF as a core, passive holding. This is fine IMO"
1825,How I Benefited From ValueInvesting,2024-03-15 22:46:15,94.0,"I studied finance in college and I currently work in book publishing at one of the Big 5 publishers, on the demand planning and inventory management end. Anyway, I started off my investing journey in late 2015 by going through an advisor. I have about 68% of my total funds invested in mutual funds, the largest holding being KNPAX, which has been very good.  
  
However, when 2020 came around I unloaded a lot of my savings in the market. Eventually, I asked him to buy a couple stocks instead of just the same mutual funds I was investing in. He explained that it would be cheaper for me to just do it on my own, so I did instead of him buying the stocks for me.   
I opened up my own brokerage acct and I did well, as anyone would at that time in mid 2020. I had a return of 89% in 2020, -1% in 2021, and -23% in 2022. But, in early 2023 I started consolidating my stock investments as I was overdiversified, I thought.  I, also, found Value Investing because I really didn’t have time to do research, and I figured I would look for adept, real individuals who were offering, what I believed to be, genuine financial and market analysis, and could defend their investment recommendations against the critics within the group. I have a good understanding of macroeconomics, financial statements, profitability, risk, etc. I have always believed in the fundamentals and value investing, but I am not suave enough and nor do I have the experience and time to make sound investments on my own, so I used this thread to guide my investments. I would look for investment recs in industries that I like(energy, healthcare, financial services, and so on), and if I liked the argument and investment pitch being made, I looked at the companies financials and gauged it as best I could  
I have invested in NMIH, PM, VNOM, CPLP, HSY, ECPG, MDT; I’m up on every one. I’ve done relatively well, partly because of this thread. I am invested in 17 stocks altogether, but I was up 22% in 2023. This group is filled with a lot of good advice, I think. It’s been very helpful to me so far. (knock on wood).

**Edit: We decided to not pursue this idea because seems a large segment of the retail value investing community would not be very interested in such a product.

We believe in shooting ideas fast, avoiding draining our time/resources into ""bad"" ideas.**

**If anyone in the future is reading this post and has the necessary skills and are interested in building an LLM to help screen stocks, we encourage you to pursue the idea.

The price is stagnant for a lot of reasons, international trade is likely a big part of why. Investors left China and apparently their market is being shorted a bunch by institutions outside of China, at least according the their government. 

I may not be correct but I think you may be mixing up market cap with actual financials like the balance sheet and book values, actual cash flows, and income. The caps have decreased hence the index's are lower but the actual industry is much, much, larger on the books then it was in 1997, it's just attributed a low price by the market. Quite a few value oriented funds have been adding and money is slowly flowing in, at least from the funds that I watch, and it's primarily because the price is too low for what actually exists.

More broadly, there are several possible factors:

1. Index composition - similar to the above
  - New listings that add to the market cap but aren't included in indices for e.g. liquidity and other reasons
  - Old constituents whose prices went nowhere, so the index doesn't go anywhere

2. Stock dilution is a possibility. This is obviously not good, but for dividend-rich markets like HK, Singapore and some countries in Europe such as the UK, a lot of returns would come through dividends rather than share price appreciation.

3. Adjustments - are you looking at the raw prices or the adjusted ones?"

HSI composition were predominantly traditional industries like banking and financial, construction etc

Those industries haven’t grown, they made money, but their earning were relatively the same as what they earned a decade ago

The spike to 30,000 is when tech industries when verticals. But at those prices points, tech was trading at 30x multiple. Not cheap by any standard now they are on the other spectrum of being sold at 10-15 multiples 

HSI financial stocks are great dividend payers,

Chinese tech like Alibaba and Tennent are priced as if they are utilities.  They are priced this way because the past 3 years their growth rate have been sub par - but they are growing again. Unlike utilities, where revenue and profits are consistent 

So depending if you are after yield or growth, I would invest accordingly

For the index to rise, it will take a change of perception

And this sub represent the current perception 

Those who never been to China will tell you about China failings, China have problems, but it’s subjective. 

Housing price downturn, is one thing every Australia or Canadian dream of so they can afford a home, increase their discretionary spending and be able to afford and start a family (solving population decline) 

Yet when China decided to pop the housing bubble, this is bad.

I'll offer another perspective.

Idk where you got your market cap data. Seems weird but would appreciate it if you share it by replying to my comment.

Here we go - what many people didn't know is that the HKD is not a real currency in a most traditional sense. It's pegged to the USD and maintained between one to 7.75-7.85. This is by design and it is China's way to making hongkong the financial portal to the world. The downside of that is the HKD is EXTREAMLY sensitive to monetary policies of the US. meaning if  the US interest rate is high, the entire worlds capital will run back to the US for some sweet risk free gains sitting in the bank. In this situation, HongKong will experiencing a liquidity crunch. With the lack of liquidity, and rumors of regional instability plus rumors of "" economy collapsing"" short sellers have completely taken over. this is worsen when local investors also withdraw seeing the index going lower and lower. 

However, the Fed have stopped the rate hikes and in my opinion they have no choice but to cut the rates comes June 2024. Liquidity will return to the Hang Seng and it will recover...like it always has. for those who deny this, let me just say that 2008 felt like the whole world was going to collapse, but it didn't lol.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions. people hate China here, and I get it.. their stocks have been falling for a few years and seems never ending. Afterall, when a stock goes down, everyone hates it. when a stock goes up the company can do no wroing...

when everyone says ""it's uninvestable"" its actually the golden opportunity to buy in my humble opinion."

There's a lack of information for foreign investors even if they are based in Hong Kong. They've continued a trend of blocking foreign investors from accessing financial information in mainland China. That in my mind is more critical for foreign investors. Regardless of the macro trends or tailwinds investors will invest into markets if they have access to information. They also for a while had tight regulations on the movement of foreign capital which they've been rolling back but again I think the biggest issue with investing into Hong Kong or China markets is it's almost impossible to get financial information unless you are a Chinese national in mainland China. 

There's not going to be any massive rush back into the Chinese exchanges until the information asymmetry is removed. You're right it's not like 2008 - this is more like if in 2008 Bloomberg and Thompson Reuters only allowed US citizens to view financial data for NYSE and NASDAQ listed companies. Even if they removed the block on information tomorrow it would take a long time for the foreign investors to go back into that market. A lot of large investors have shifted that regional investment into India which has been doing spectacularly and has been opening themselves up to foreign investments.

One investment thesis for investing in China is to front run the higher amount of money coming into stocks from China itself as its population moves towards the middle class.

1. **Increase in Listed Companies**: The total market capitalization of a stock market grows when new companies list their shares through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Over the years, both the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have seen a significant increase in the number of listed companies. This increase in the number of shares available contributes to the overall market capitalization, even if individual stock prices do not rise substantially.

2. **Share Issuance by Existing Companies**: Existing companies may issue new shares to raise capital. While this increases the total market capitalization, it can dilute existing shares if not accompanied by proportional growth in the company's earnings or assets. This dilution can prevent the stock price from rising, even as the market cap grows.

3. **Economic Growth vs. Stock Market Performance**: While China's economy has grown significantly over the past two decades, stock market performance does not always directly correlate with economic growth. Factors such as market sentiment, interest rates, regulatory changes, and global economic conditions can affect stock prices. Furthermore, the stock market reflects the performance and expectations of public companies, which may not cover all sectors of the economy.

4. **Investor Sentiment and Valuation**: Market dynamics and investor sentiment play crucial roles in stock prices. If investors believe that the market or specific sectors are overvalued, they may be reluctant to invest, leading to stagnant or declining stock prices despite growing market capitalization.

5. **Regulatory and Market Structure**: The regulatory environment and market structure can also impact stock prices. In China, there are restrictions on foreign investment and capital movement, which can affect stock market dynamics. Additionally, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role in the Chinese market, and their stock performance can be influenced by government policies and objectives, rather than purely market-driven factors."

Let me tell you this much…

If China really had NO future, the whole world would be in deep 💩. A country with no future is a reckless country willing to do anything to stay afloat… and with China’s vast resources… it won’t be fun to watch.

For example, China could easily sell the trillion dollars in US federal debt it owns — tanking the value of US bonds and sending US interest payments spiralling out of control. China will take a huge loss to make that happen, but it wouldn’t matter because — according to you — they have no future. What a ridiculous take."

China isn't going to dissapear, but them being a world economic player will.  Other economies with far better labor support and logistics will take their spot on the global stage.  Investing anything in China at this point is a massive risk and international companies are already realizing this and bringing back manufacturing to the shores before the collapse happens.
