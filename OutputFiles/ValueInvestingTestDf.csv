They kind of started with the same of one division. 

CLPR; earnings were today. NOI of $80mill and once their next development is complete, along with full tax abatement for Flatbush  NOI will be closer to $90-100mill for 2024 FY.  5% cap rate on NOI puts PPE at 1.9-2bill in value. Debt is fixed and worth 1.2bill, walk away with 700mill on a 200 mill mcap stock all while collecting a 7-8% dividend that’s tax free since they are running a loss and most of it converts to returned capital.

TPL:  1mill acres of Texas land locked up in this trust all leased to oil giants and collects a nice royalty each year to buy back stock and pay a dividend.

46,Berkshire Bought Back About $2.3 Billion in Stock - Barron's on MSN,2024-03-15 23:12:02,2.0,"  
[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/berkshire-bought-back-about-23-billion-in-stock/ar-BB1jYwLc](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/berkshire-bought-back-about-23-billion-in-stock/ar-BB1jYwLc)   
  
Story by Andrew Bary  
  
Berkshire Hathaway bought back about $2.3 billion in stock in the first quarter through March 6, based on a Barron’s calculation from information in the company’s proxy statement released late Friday.  
  
The company repurchased about 3,800 Class A shares (with Class B stock buybacks converted to an equivalent amount of Class A shares) from year-end 2023 through March 6.  
  
The $2.3 billion of repurchases marks a pickup from the $2.2 billion of stock that Berkshire repurchased in the fourth quarter and could mean $3 billion or more of buybacks for the current quarter if the pace of repurchases continues at the rate of the first two months of the year.  
  
Most of the buybacks in the quarter occurred from Feb. 13 to March 6, with Barron’s estimating that total at around $1.7 billion with about $600 million repurchased in the first six weeks of the quarter.  
Investors watch the pace of Berkshire’s buybacks as an indication of whether Buffett views the stock as cheaply valued since he determines the pace of repurchases and has said repeatedly that he is price conscious.  
  
Berkshire stock has been strong this year with the Class A and B shares up about 14% against a roughly 7.5% total return for the S&P 500 index. The Class A stock finished Friday at $618,133, up 0.9%, while the Class B shares ended at $408.13, up 0.3%  
  
The proxy also discloses that Greg Abel, the likely successor to CEO Warren Buffett, earned just over $20 million in total compensation last year, up from $19 million in 2022.  
  
Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, heads the company’s vast non-insurance operations. Ajit Jain, who oversees the company’s insurance businesses, also earned just over $20 million last year. Buffett, who determines their pay, has compensated them equally since they were elevated to their current positions in 2018.  
  
Berkshire continues to operate differently from other big companies on executive pay.  
  
For starters, Buffett is paid a salary of $100,000 a year with no bonus—a level of compensation he has received for over 35 years. The proxy states that he doesn’t want an increase in pay.  
  
He may be the only major CEO who reimburses the company for minor items such as phone calls and postage that are personal in nature. He reimbursed Berkshire $50,000 for those incidental expenses in 2023, in keeping with payments in past years.  
  
Berkshire spent over $300,000 on Buffett’s personal security last year, which is counted as compensation. But that is a fraction of companies such as Meta Platforms spend on their CEO security.  
  
Buffett pays for his own personal jet travel on NetJets, a Berkhsire company, and the company doesn’t pay for cars or country club dues for executives.  
  
Buffett hates parting with Berkshire Hathaway stock, viewing every share as precious, and doesn’t grant stock compensation to executives or any employees. The company states emphatically in the proxy: “Berkshire never intends to use Berkshire stock in compensating employees.”  
  
Berkshire lets Buffett set the compensation for Abel and Jain, and the proxy states the factors Buffett uses “typically are subjective.” There are no incomprehensible formulas like there are at most public companies. And Berkshire doesn’t use compensation consultants in setting executive pay.  
  
Both Buffett and Charlie Munger, the Berkshire vice chairman who died at 99 in late 2023, dislike consultants of all kinds. Munger once said that he would rather “throw an asp down my shirt front” than hire one.  
  
Buffett once said that if Berkshire uses pay consultants after his death, he will rise from his grave in anger. Their view has been that companies use pay consultants to inflate executive compensation.","['or', 'up', 'pays', 'Back', 'msn', 'view', 'ar', 'he', 'be', 'an', 'for', 'by', 'For', 'back', 'www', 'rise', 'pay', 'cars', 'six', 'MSN', 'any', 'big', 'on', 'has', 'Both', 'He', 'all', 'Meta', 'are', 'two']",,

Remember, if you have ordinary income, dividends have their own tax, PLUS they push your income into a higher tax bracket. A dollar of dividends might have a 15% tax  plus push a dollar of income from the 24% to 32% bracket, making the effective tax on that dividend 23%.

Cigarettes are on a decline, yes, but at a snails-pace. From 2019 to 2023 BTI cigarette sales have declined only about 3%.

(Example: BTI Vapour products had 401mil in sales in 2019, and now it's at 1802mil).

Anyway, I started off my investing journey in late 2015 by going through an advisor. I have about 68% of my total funds invested in mutual funds, the largest holding being KNPAX, which has been very good.  
  
However, when 2020 came around I unloaded a lot of my savings in the market. Eventually, I asked him to buy a couple stocks instead of just the same mutual funds I was investing in. He explained that it would be cheaper for me to just do it on my own, so I did instead of him buying the stocks for me.   
I opened up my own brokerage acct and I did well, as anyone would at that time in mid 2020. I had a return of 89% in 2020, -1% in 2021, and -23% in 2022. But, in early 2023 I started consolidating my stock investments as I was overdiversified, I thought.  I, also, found Value Investing because I really didn’t have time to do research, and I figured I would look for adept, real individuals who were offering, what I believed to be, genuine financial and market analysis, and could defend their investment recommendations against the critics within the group. I have a good understanding of macroeconomics, financial statements, profitability, risk, etc. I have always believed in the fundamentals and value investing, but I am not suave enough and nor do I have the experience and time to make sound investments on my own, so I used this thread to guide my investments. I would look for investment recs in industries that I like(energy, healthcare, financial services, and so on), and if I liked the argument and investment pitch being made, I looked at the companies financials and gauged it as best I could  
I have invested in NMIH, PM, VNOM, CPLP, HSY, ECPG, MDT; I’m up on every one. I’ve done relatively well, partly because of this thread. I am invested in 17 stocks altogether, but I was up 22% in 2023. This group is filled with a lot of good advice, I think. It’s been very helpful to me so far. (knock on wood).    
  
Just wanted to say thanks and to share,

Oil & gas majors got irrationally blown to hell after COVID and they are usually categorized as value, oil & gas majors largely reverted, hence value outperformed.

So is it really that value outperformed or just that oil & gas majors outperformed after their stocks crashed?

Edit: Oh god it's comparing value indices to growth indices, not value to total... that makes things even less informative since growth is largely comprised of digital/tech companies that got a huge temporary boost in stock prices, again, due to COVID."
