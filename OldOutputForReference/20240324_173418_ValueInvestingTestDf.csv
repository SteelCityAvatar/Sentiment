Shares seem to trade around fair value.,2024-03-24 20:40:12,3.0,"Oracle released its fiscal Q3 earnings report a couple of weeks back, and after underperforming major indices for the last six months, shares jumped over 10% on the results. What do we think of Oracle shares right now? Are they still attractive enough, or are there better opportunities out there? 

(We published a full analysis of the Q3 results right here for those looking for more of a deep dive: [https://rijnberkinvestinsights.substack.com/p/oracle-corporation-a-fiscal-q3-earnings](https://rijnberkinvestinsights.substack.com/p/oracle-corporation-a-fiscal-q3-earnings))

Here are some bullet points for reference:

* Since September 2023, Oracle shares have underperformed, returning 15% against S&P's 17%, lagging behind peers like Microsoft, Amazon, and SAP.
* Oracle Corporation is a global technology company known for its comprehensive range of database software, cloud engineering, and enterprise software products and services.
* Oracle's flagship product is the Oracle Database, which is renowned for its robustness, reliability, scalability, and security. It also offers various enterprise software solutions, such as CRM, ERP, HCM, and SCM software.
* Despite mature industries offering little growth potential, Oracle has been on an acquisition spree, acquiring 150 companies over ten years for a total of $110 billion, aiming to boost revenue.
* Recognizing the shift to the cloud, Oracle has been making significant investments in developing its cloud infrastructure and services, capturing a 2% market share in the global cloud industry.

&#x200B;

* Oracle's Q3 results showed top-line growth accelerating, mainly driven by cloud revenue, up 24% YoY to $5.1 billion, with cloud infrastructure operations showing strong performance.
* Cloud revenue includes SaaS revenues, such as Fusion Cloud ERP and NetSuite Cloud ERP, which grew 14% in Q3 to $3.3 billion, driven by customer migrations to the cloud.

&#x200B;

* Oracle has consistently expanded its margins over recent quarters, with the cloud services and license support gross margin improving to 77%.
* Operating income increased by 12% YoY to $5.8 billion, with an operating margin of 44%, driven by efficiencies in operating expenses.
* Net income margin expanded by 270 bps, driving net income up 18% YoY to $4 billion, resulting in an EPS of $1.41, up 16% YoY.
* Oracle's FCF grew by 68% over the last 12 months to $12.3 billion, helping improve its balance sheet despite elevated debt levels.
* Oracle's total cash position is $9.5 billion compared to its long-term debt of $82.5 billion, reflecting ongoing efforts to lower debt while returning cash to shareholders. Still, this balance sheet is far from pretty. 

&#x200B;

* Management remains optimistic about its cloud services, expecting growth to accelerate in fiscal FY25, and Q4 revenue projected to grow between 4% and 6% YoY.
* Based on financial projections, Oracle shares trade at just below 23x this year's earnings or around fair value. A DCF, among other valuation methods, shows shares have the potential to return 11-12% annually in the medium term.

104,Some words of wisdom on investing overseas that is still relevant today. Christopher Browne (2007),2024-03-24 06:45:46,10.0,"Source: The little book of Value Investing by Christopher H. Browne. (2007)

Page 54:

In my pursuit of global investment opportunities, I choose to invest principally in the developed countries of the world like Switzerland. I look for stable economies, as well as a reasonable form of government. The so-called emerging markets have a tendency to never quite emerge and remain unsafe and unstable places for investment. Although they can be the source of enormous speculative profits from time to time, they can also be the source of staggering, rapid losses. Look at Venezuela or Argentina. Investing in countries like this ignores the concept of having a margin of safety, and is a game I do not care to play.  
  
For every emerging market success story, there has been a disaster of at least equal or greater proportions in these undeveloped markets. I have seen tremendous economic upheaval in places such as Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Russian markets had been a gold mine initially, and then hyperinflation hit. All the ""smart guys"" were buying Russian short-term notes with yields in excess of 50 percent. Seems too good to be true? It was. Russia eventually defaulted on the notes and left investors with nothing but memories of their money. By the time Russian debt was unfrozen after a 90-day trading and interest halt, the ensuing currency collapse had left Western speculators with devastating losses.  
  
In the early 1990s, Mexico was the darling of the investing world. The Mexican market kept climbing to new highs. It appeared that Mexico had finally gained an understanding of capitalism and with its enormous store of natural resources was ready to take its rightful place among the strong economies of the world. The media proclaimed loudly that, at last, Mexico would be first world nation. Then, a few political assassinations and a sudden currency devaluation later, we discovered that global money managers financed the entire run-up. The Mexican stock market imploded with disastrous results. Had Bill Clinton and the United States not stepped in with a generous stabilization aid package, the entire nation of Mexico might well have gone bankrupt. Needless to say, investors suffered enormous losses.  
  
In the mid-1960s, My brother Will served in the Peace Corps in South America, where he got a lesson in Latin rule of law: Sometimes the laws work and sometimes they don't. Argentina has gone from bust to being the darling of Latin America in the 1990s. Now it is bust again. And look at the most recent disasters in Venezuela and Bolivia. Elections have brought socialist leaders who are cozying up to Fidel Castro and nationalizing foreign company assets. Why bother to invest in countries that are this unstable?   
  
Until the late 1990s, East Asia was the darling of the emerging markets investing world. Countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand had experienced enormous economic growth with internal growth rates as high as 8 to12 percent. It was hailed wide and far as the Asian economic miracle. As it became evident that foreign investment, and not increased productivity, had financed all this growth, the balloon began to deflate. In 1997, with the taste of the Mexican crisis still in their mouths, investors began to flee the East Asian countries with disastrous results. In Thailand, the stock market fell over 75 percent. The Philippine market lost over one-third. In three days in October, the Hong Kong markets lost 23 percent and the government eventually spent billions to prop up local equity and currency markets. In Malaysia, the exchange lost over 50 percent. Singapore, considered one of the most stable of the East Asian tigers, dropped over 60 percent. These are not the risks that I consider to  be consistent with a margin of safety.  
  
There seems to be a boom-bust cycle in all the less developed markets. Early investors reap fast profits and then an excess flood of foreign investment and cash pushes the local economy to the point of a speculative bubble. It is a dangerous way to invest, as those left holding the bag will find the bag is empty.   
   
As I write this, there is enormous investor interest in China. The world's most populous nation seems to be waking up to the joys of capitalism. It is growing at a very rapid pace and has a huge population. Despite this, there may be significant dangers ahead. China is still a communist country. The government still owns or controls many of the listed and traded companies both on the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Investors are a silent partner with no recourse to protect them should the government decide to change policies. Again, the margin of safety appears to be missing.  
  
Rather than tread the savannahs of the African interior, or the steppes of Siberia, or even the slopes of the Andes Mountains, more than sufficient profits are available if I mostly stick to stable economies with stable governments. This includes all of Western Europe, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, and non-Chinese companies in Hong Kong. In these stable, mostly democratic, and capitalist nations, I continue to look for stocks that hold the same characteristics of value as do U.S. companies.""

They live off the oil and gas. Their leaders aren't too bothered about building the sort of diplomatic links, infrastructure, or the sort of society that encourages industrial growth. At some point the value of oil vs industrial production might change that, but it's not there yet.

Why did manufacturing move to China? Largely because the cost of reliable communications fell. Someone in the USA could easily communicate with a factory manager in China about what was going on. You could send an email requesting 5000 widgets be produced like you couldn't have done in the 1970s. Why has the Chilean wine industry grown so much?

My big thing about investing in emerging markets is how much potential there is and that you can predict certain sorts of growth that follows other growth by looking at other countries. China is on the same path as Taiwan and Korea. You can see that they're now starting to move out of just making other people's things to creating their own car companies, their own electronics companies."

Crowdstrike is a great business, have it on my watchlist since April/2023, but just too expensive. 
I prefer Fortinet over PANW for a few reasons.
- PANW management not too shareholder friendly. Too much stock based compensation has been diluting shareholders since ipo. On the contrary, Fortinet does not rely as much on stock based compensation and has been reducing shares outstanding since 2017 through buybacks. Also, Fortinet is founder led, which I also like, since incentives are more aligned with shareholders.
- Fortinet is more profitable - operating margin 23% vs 6% for PANW. They also are superior capital alocators - ROIC of 21% vs 16%; ROCE 45% (and climbing) vs 6% for PANW.
- In their last earnings call, PANW announced that they would attempt to consolidate the cybersecurity market by offering services basically for free in an attempt to convince companies that have several cybersecurity services in different companies with different contract termination dates to convince them to ditch those other companies and contract all services with PANW. I think it is never good for shareholders when companies resort to price drops and gifts to attempt to gain market share, it shows that they have no moat. That is why the market punished them.

Edit: you are correct.  It can help determine the value of a company currently to see what it is worth if everything is liquidated on the spot.  But, apparently it can be misleading if the current assets aren't ""true"" assets and must be used in conjunction with things like the Quick Ratio.  Hence the Quick Ratio is listed beneath it on the site.  A current ratio above 1 is generally considered to be favorable.

That said, I agree with you, and what you are saying speaks to their business models which is important when finding great companies.

I don't have a big family, so I'm not who Costco has in mind. I am a value shopper; I won't pay top dollar, but I also won't buy the bottom of the line on products where it won't last or is substancially inferior. That's Walmart.

326,The S&P 500 is not severely overpriced,2024-03-23 13:49:17,14.0,"Today in just 8 points, not only I will prove you why the trending post is wrong and provocative but, also, I'll show why there is no indicator that tells the S&P 500 is severly overpriced. 


1 - Let's start with game theory : If a multiplier was enough to predict the future... (Well this sounds funny already)... Everyone would do it. But if everyone would do it, no one could profit from it. Since profits can be made, this proves already that they can't rely on multiplier absolute values alone.


2) Market forecasting using only one variable in a complex scenario like the world economy, is pointless. Making the post more like a journalistic/panic selling article rather than a scientific analysis. 


3) When did price to sales started actually to matter? Profits is what really matters to investors. 


4) **PE/PS is consequence not a cause**.   
Bubbles explode when you don't expect. Calling for a market crash is not something that can be predicted by using numbers known to everyone. We need proof that something is wrong in the economy, book cooking, market manipulation, unreasonable hype, etc.   
During dot com, the problem was not the Nasdaq PE at 300 (everyone knew that). The problem was that dot com companies were not realistic about storytelling...


5) Current PE SP 500 is at 28. Which is at historical highs, BUT the **same thing could have been repeated for almost every day of the last 25-30 years**. So being at historical high PE levels doesn't mean much about the expected market returns. And there is another reason for that (point six). 


6) PE during 1929 bubble was 13.  
PE of a market has **NOT a constant absolute value of reference**, but it rather depends on how much money is attracted by 3 main factors: risk free rate, market risk rate and growth expectations. The first has been falling for the last 40 years, the second has reduced especially in the last years due to economy strength and reliability.   
So these drive higher valuations and you can see by yourself that the SP 500 PE ratio has been on an increasing trend for the last 45 years.  
(Edited due to inaccuracy)   
Edit 2: **Many are pointing out that interest rates are high now so PE should be lower**. This is right. My answer is that market knows it and is already pricing in the rate cuts, plus growth expectations of some stocks has improved. 


7) The market is forward looking, obviously. And since market today is very very very different from 50 years ago, investors are different as well. So backward PE or PS analysis can be misleading without context. 


8) SP 500 today is dominated by the tech industry more than ever, and since tech has high PE for obvious reasons and bullish growth sentiment on AI... Avg. weighted PE is inevitably higher.

I disagree with brushing off the PE ratio like that. Your post reads as if you're looking at stocks primarily as a graph line that wiggles up or down. And the quoted part in particular is ""the stick has been bending more and more so it can keep on bending without breaking"".

No amount of mental gymnastics changes the fact that the market is overvalued. Given the S&P500 EPS has historically grown at 6.5% per year (about 3.5-4% inflation and 2.5-3% growth), strong evidence suggests this will continue into the medium & long-term future. Earnings yields are highly predictive of future stock returns. This does not come from a small amount of data but 150 years of stock market data. 

You said the current s&p500 PE is 29x. Said another way, the s&p500 earnings yield is 3.45%. The risk free yield is 4.2% but you can also get 5.3% in T-Bills. I can expect to get better returns from owning both short and long term bonds with essentially no risk than owning risky equities. While you could argue EPS growth will be higher than the historical 6.5% justifying a higher PE and thus lower earnings yield, I could just as easily argue a lower EPS growth thus a lower PE and higher justified earnings yield.

Price to sales doesn't matter that much. Your 1929 argument actually works against your argument because like in the 1920s, there was an unstainable acceleration in earnings which collapsed in the following decade. While the PE ratios were normal, the CAPE ratio was exceedingly high and predictive of a crash. It just so happens the CAPE ratio is near 1929 levels along with high nominal PE ratios."

About half of the S&P 500 performance from last decade comes from the repricing from 18 p/e to 28 p/e. And that gave the S&P 500 an outstanding 11% CAGR performance. Will people still flock blindly to S&P if it gives 6-7% instead of 11% from now on? Will p/e go to 40+ just because?  

At some point market will bring p/e down we just don’t know when.

2) Short-term, market forecasting is indeed meaningless. Long-term, p/e and CAPE p/e has been good indicator of expected future returns

3) agree. It’s about profits. And that’s why p/e is important.

4) agree no one can predict when markets will correct. But at 28-29 p/e expected returns are significantly less than when it’s at 16 p/e

6) higher p/e means shares have become pricier. Not that they are better.

8) there is no obvious reason for tech to have higher p/e. Established slow growing tech like IBM have normal p/e. Higher p/e must come with expected earnings growth, tech by itself doesn’t grant higher p/e. 

Disclaimer: 
I’m not a perma-bear and I am fully invested as I know I can’t predict timing of highs and lows.

Equity risk premiums, therefore, were an absolute steal. Now we have equity risk premiums at record highs, non cash-flow assets like gold and bitcoin at ATHs, every sector except oil at higher pe multiples than 2021 (ZIRP, QE infinity), BDCs and homebuilders trading well over book value, high yield credit spreads the narrowest since 2007, and average SP500 growth that has been nominally stagnant for a couple years despite massive inflation. So your bullet number 5 is wrong, and point 6 needs context (falling bond yields until now).

Second, today's market is different than before, no doubt. It is full of algos and momentum traders that don't care about valuation until value investors and macro traders start selling, in which case these momentum traders will reverse things so fast that your account will blow up in a wink. So where is your margin of safety? If you are buying at absurd valuations, you need to be prepared to get crushed when the musical chairs of grater fools comes to an end. To succeed in the market, you either need to have ingenious hedges in place, be respecting value of distributing assets (like bonds which will keep paying no matter what), or get lucky. The buy-and-hold crowd is betting that central banks never get converted from their print-to-infinity religion, and most of these ""investors"" (gamblers, actually) could never articulate what the real risks actually are. I have personally designed some complex put options strategies that I feel decently comfortable with to pair with buy-and-hold, but if I didn't have these I would be trimming hard right now (as it is, I've been adding REITs).

Third, as for your reference to game theory, all's fair in love, war, and capitalism. Getting the media to tell you that valuations don't matter so dumb money keeps buying when smart money is pulling the rug, is exactly what happened late 2021. Then getting media to tell you valuations matter don't buy tech in 2022 (while COST and PG were at nose-bleed multiples) was also pure play. Now the narrative is valuations don't matter, all over again. Valuations don't matter, that is true. But realize that the very statement that ""valuations don't matter"" is part of the game.

Here is my thought: I invest in a company long-term if I believe the rate of return is long term so much higher than t-bills that it justifies the risk. I use long term earnings as what is returned to me as a shareholder, either through dividends or dividends. Price cannot grow long term independent of underlying value.

Right now, companies make less than 4% (E/P) on the invested dollar, which is below what I make risk free with a t-bill. So the only way that this can work long term if companies grow much faster (which should be part of forward p/e). And I don't believe that. 

Your post has a strong vibe of ""efficient market hypothesis"". But we know short term traders dominate the market. Market bullshit happens. Most of us also remember 2022, which I think was absolutely foreseeable.

Also P/E ratio of the S&P is a great indicator of the market is overpriced or not. It is a direct correlation between the price of the stock and its earnings. It is obviously not an indicator of which direction the market is going to flow, but only a cause for concern when it starts getting high.

Right. High PE is a consequence of an overvalued market that is due for correction.

Kind of right, kind of wrong. You can look at it relative to its historical levels, but you can also look at it as a raw number and compare it to the risk free rate to determine if it's giving you a reasonable risk premium over treasuries.

>7) The market is forward looking, obviously. And since market today is very very very different from 50 years ago, investors are different as well. So backward PE or PS analysis can be misleading without context.

Ok. This just reads to me like a qualitative opinion. I don't really know how it refutes the quantitative validity of price ratios as a mechanism of valuation.

>8) SP 500 today is dominated by the tech industry more than ever, and since tech has high PE for obvious reasons and bullish growth sentiment on AI... Avg. weighted PE is inevitably higher.

The ""obvious reasons"" aren't so obvious. What we call ""tech"" today has always more or less existed in some form or another, and one general principle has held fast: expected/predicted growth is usually far higher than actual growth."

Should it remain flat, trend up, or trend down over time?

For any option, why?

My wager? P/e's for exceptional companies could trend upward with time as predictability of earnings growth from compounded opportunity demands an increased p/e, and predictability of compounding is supported by technological advancement and management with clear vision.

So, just through management education alone (read: if the average manager in the 2020s is better than the average manager in the 1960s, maybe because the job of management has been demystified somewhat over time and conveyed through books like Effective executive, Innovators Dilemma, and Competitng against luck), one can argue the average p/e for more average companies could also trend up with time, as their modus operandi can become aligned with theories that empirically compound returns more effectively, justifying pricing a higher p/e."

Now with America having awakened in 2020 to the dire consequences of de-industrialization, we are in a more historically normal era. The policy of the United States is renewed industrialization. The result will be interest rates, as seen even now, adhering to historic norms, not the aberrant lows.

The internet and computers were around for a few decades before they really became a mainstay that changed people's day to day lives and evolved into megacorporations. And that was met with its own Dotcom bubble. And those inventions arguably needed other innovations to really take off, namely the smartphone. Regardless of what people might think or fear, actual implementation and adoption of AI and AI tools is going to take some time. Everyone talks about manufacturing and automation but the economy has so many millions of jobs that are just routine administrative, scheduling, finance, reporting jobs, etc. that could be done with AI and 10% of the number of current workers. To me, that's where the real economic impact of AI exists but I think it will take decades and happen gradually.

In terms of the stocks, I think that's why it's not unreasonable to be thinking things like NVDA are due for a pullback sometime in the near-ish future, because we need to see if these companies are really going to walk the walk when it comes to AI, and have revenues to show for it, or if it is 90% hype for now."

Plus there is a bit of a local monopoly depending on the US regions since what works in some places can't work elsewhere, so you have expert homebuilders that know certain regions really well. 

Also I think the style/quality/speed of homebuilders are important differentiators in the competitive market. 

I personally have been invested in Dreamfinders Home (DFH) for a while and I've been up a healthy amount. They have been growing rapidly due to their presence in high growth locations like Austin TX, Jacksonville FL, NC etc. They are asset light and focused on giving customization to new homeowners so that commands a bit of a premium, while keeping costs low. Revenue growth is high, they consistently beat earnings, they keep acquiring small homebuilders. P/E ratio is high compared to competitors but that's because they're the only ones growing during this high interest rate environment. 

Anyway, I'm sure there's many other opportunities out there in the homebuilders sector, DFH has run up a lot so not sure if its still undervalued but the whole sector as a whole will get juiced once interest rates fall.

579,Which Alternative Asset Manager to Invest In: Blackstone (BX) vs. Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) vs. Others?,2024-03-23 17:20:28,24.0,"I've been researching alternative asset managers lately and I'm torn between a few options. I'm particularly interested in companies with diversified portfolios, strong track records, and global presence. Currently, I'm looking closely at Blackstone Group (BX) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), but I'm open to considering others as well.

&#x200B;

Here's a quick overview of what I've found:

**Blackstone Group (BX):** A global alternative investment manager with a focus on private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions, and credit.

**Brookfield Asset Management (BAM):** Also operating globally, Brookfield has investments across various sectors including real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity, and credit.

&#x200B;

Other contenders include **KKR & Co. Inc. (KKR)**, **Carlyle Group (CG)**, **Apollo Global Management (APO)**, **BlackRock (BLK)**, each offering their own unique strengths and investment opportunities.I'm reaching out to the Reddit community to hear your thoughts and experiences.

I have performed an analysis of S&P 500 performance in relation to the index's price-to-sales ratio since 1928, and here is what I have found (all returns are with dividends reinvested):
1) When P/S ratio is <0.5, the annualized return over the subsequent 5 years is 12.1% yearly
2) P/S 0.5 to 0.8: 10.2% yearly return over 5 years

Do with this information what you would like. Personally, I am holding what I own, but no longer buying. I have no idea when the drop will come, but the S&P will have to revert, at some point, towards its historical average P/S ratio of 1.71. That's 39.8% lower than it is currently.

This is basically creating zombie stocks and further pivoting the market from creating value that will eventually translate into a higher stock price to the “all it takes” to inflate the stock price strategy.

There is no way the math adds up on the market right now. The fundamentals aren’t there for most of this companies. The overall world economy is going through a rough patch and tensions are rising everywhere.

However, there are a couple of other data points that challenge this view:

1. Certain measures already show high retail participation in the markets - though it's admittedly a mixed bag. We are expecting a relatively soft landing, yet the market seems to be pricing in high growth rates - the two don't quite jive. There's also the inconvenient matter of the yield curve inversion, which hardly inspires confidence.

2. The sustainability of profitability is an open debate. In particular, a lot of the higher profits from the tech giants come from:

   a. Increased AI-related income. Nvidia is the clearest example here - so the bet is that their clients would see the returns on investment - else demand will taper off.

   b. Workforce reductions. For existing businesses this should be relatively OK, barring the increased risk of outages. However, it remains to be seen whether these cuts will affect their innovation businesses and therefore growth. The market hasn't just factored in current profitability, but **growing profits** as well. You can increase profitability from cuts, but you can't generally grow by cutting.

So there are arguments for and against - it's difficult to say definitively which point we are at right now, other than that the mood is possibly approaching euphoria."

S&P 500 is currently overvalued and seems like it will continue to be overvalued for some time unless the majority of investors stop investing or interest rates dramatically increase.

It is a fact that as valuations increase, expected returns decrease, and at high enough valuations, expected returns can reach negative numbers. Expected future long-term returns continue to decrease. Right now, the expectation is about 4 to 6% and may continue decreasing as valuations increase.

Perhaps in the future, there will be a large correction that will reset expected returns back to normal or higher return rates. Perhaps valuations will continue growing, thus decreasing long-term growth. We don't know exactly what's going to happen.

That is why diversity beyond one market is crucial. Research also supports this. I am currently invested in u.s total market, developed, emerging, and factor titled investment towards value and size in both local and foreign markets.

Interesting to me is seeing the lows of the tech bubble get retested by the lows of the housing crisis. Then it only went higher from there. If the next crisis sent us to covid lows, thats around 2100-2500 on the S&P. If you hacked it down 60% from todays level, you get 2,093.672. Imo thats too low.

I would just contribute a set amount of my income into an IRA or 401(k) index mutual fund or ETF and forget about it. But I'm retired and the money I've saved is basically my pension, so I take a more active role in managing it. There are a lot of people in the stock market today who have never been truly baptized by a bear market. I have. By ""bear market"" I mean the type of market that takes a significant hit but then basically trends down or sideways (inflation adjusted) for a decade or more trying to get back to even, like the periods from the 1929 peak to 1958 following the Great Depression and 1968 to 1992 following two oil shocks and the inflationary 1970s. Whether we're nearing one of these inflection points or not is anyone's guess, but I think there are definitely signs of froth in recent years, whether we're talking about SPACS, MEME stocks, crypto, or, now, AI. It seems like every Zoomer or Millennial at least has a friend who has a Webull or Coinbase account and is trading currency and stock options, AI stocks, or crypto. I'm not saying there is no value in any of these things, especially AI. There obviously is. But we are experiencing the sort of technological revolution that can fuel asset bubbles and cause normally rational people to take more risk than they otherwise would.

I think now is a good time to dust off advice given decades ago that many people are familiar with but who don't possess its full context or do but just ignore it because they're making money and anyone in T-bills is a chump:

>""\[O\]ccasional outbreaks of those two super-contagious diseases, fear and greed, will forever occur in the investment community.  The timing of these epidemics will be unpredictable.  And the market aberrations produced by them will be equally unpredictable, both as to duration and degree.  
>  
>Therefore, we never try to anticipate the arrival or departure of either disease.  Our goal is more modest: We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.""

So while I'm not engaging in the wholesale dumping of stocks or advocating that anyone do that, I am, like Buffett, maintaining a higher than usual level of liquidity. I'm not greedy. I'll take the 5% return I can get sitting in T-bills and be prepared to increase my allocation to stocks after a quantitative drop in the market. I consider it a sort of opportunistic poor man's portfolio insurance. For the moment, I just collect dividends in the stocks I do own and trade around a set allocation for each company in my portfolio. If one of them takes a dump, like Dick's did after an earnings call last fall, I buy more of it. Lately more and more of my picks--companies like Dick's, Williams Sonoma, KLA, Marathon Petroleum, etc.--have been outgrowing their allocations, so I pare them down.

Everyone cheered and on September 18th the Dow Jones Industrials had its biggest rally in five years. Markets peaked the following month, and three months later our economy entered the worst economic decline since the Great Depression.

Is there a best practice for building a desired position gradually? 

I saw people writing they usually do it in 2-3 buys.

Until now when I analyzed a company, if I liked it for the current price I would just buy the entire desired position in one buy. 

Is there a reason why it is not advised?

If one buys only a partial position at first they risk the share price going up and not being able to build the entire position they wanted. Of course the price can also go down or sideways, but why drive oneself crazy trying to catch short term movements?

See the section below on its cash flow sensitivity and valuation (from our part 2 report):

Like other Canadian oil sands operators, Strathcona has tremendous cash flow torque to higher oil prices. It will be a prime beneficiary as the WTI-WCS differential compresses over the next few months as the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project enters service.

Assuming 190,000 boe/d of production growth, $1.3 billion of total capex, US$80 per barrel WTI, $2.50 per mcf AECO, and a $14.50 WTI-WCS differential, Strathcona will generate the following free cash flow yield on its current share price of $25 at different commodity prices:


If the shares were to trade at a 12% free cash flow yield, their return prospects at different commodity prices from their current price would look like the following:


Clearly, the shares have tremendous cash flow torque to oil prices. If WTI is sustained above US$90 per barrel, they offer more than 100% returns from their current price.

Our discounted cash flow value uses the same assumptions as above and values the shares at $34.02, which implies 36% upside.


Of course, production growth, commodity price increases, effective capital allocation, and sustainable cost reductions could all create further upside for shareholders.

Given the discount to value, we would prefer management allocate free cash flow to repurchases. However, large share repurchases would exacerbate the negatives listed above. While they wouldn’t reduce intrinsic value per share—quite the contrary, in fact—they would frustrate management’s intent to provide liquidity for Waterous Energy Fund investors, at least in the near term.

We therefore expect free cash flow to be distributed to shareholders via dividends. Strathcona is likely to establish a base dividend and pay variable dividends once it hits its debt target, which we expect in the second half.

Conclusion

Oil prices are going to be rangebound for a while. As sentiment has shifted to the bull side and the physical market weakening, we need refining margins to remain strong to keep crude structurally higher. Once global refinery maintenance season is over and global demand increases (seasonality), that will be the time for the next leg higher in crude.

Meanwhile, energy stocks should continue to benefit from the rangebound price action. As oil slowly grinds higher throughout the rest of the year, we see energy stocks materially outperforming their tech counterparts. This should be a very good year for energy investors.”

I start to see some of the posts regarding the S&P 500 being overvalued or signs of bubble. Different people have different opinion and they see things differently.

  
At this point, you can get the rough idea of how the market is overvalued or not by having some check-lists or valuation model but it is still hard to determine the direction the market will move to correctly because it is a non-linear function with almost infinite parameters.

  
What I want to say is there are force that drives the US market upward for decades such as

1. Innovation: The US houses the best innovation in the past centuries from cars, computers, machineries, planes to software (even some of these prototypes aren't originating from the US)
2. Value creation: There always be someone who will risk funding your idea to make it happen (of course, if they sound great and is likely to create value). Another example would be the US market is open to listed start-ups, you can see much larger amount of not-yet-profit companies than anywhere else, this implies investors here are willing to appraise value of ideas. 
3. Intense competition: people strive to get better (more and more productive) of each other so that they can get the big reward (capitalism)
4. Liquidity: we have already left the Gold Standard, so we have much higher liquidity than 100 years ago and thus drives value of everything up (u/Excellent\_Border\_302 has explained in his/her comment on my previous post)
5. Taxation: US companies often pay smaller dividend and repurchase shares because of high dividend taxation rate, this increases stock value and thus price
6. Low cost index funds: Large amount of liquidity flows into these funds like VOO or SPY each year from payrolls, on the basis that equity carries the best return for long term investment

and more...

What I think is should some of these ceased to be true (e.g. back to Gold Standard or lack of innovation) this would affect the S&P 500 performance.","['or', 'up', 'be', 'it', 'by', 'back', 'Low', 'Are', 'has', 'best', 'ups', 'say', 'Gold', 'you', 'so', 'see', 'else', 'SPY', 'post', 'ago', 'cost', 'for', 'move', 'pay', 'true', 'cars', 'big', 'on', 'all', 'hard', 'aren', 'open', 'are', 'can']",,

1008,Are these the reasons why the US market has gone up for the many decades?,2024-03-23 18:17:56,,,"['up', 'when', 'be', 'it', 'Can', 'out', 'any', 'has', 'way', 'USA', 'So', 'When', 'so', 'cash', 'do', 'for', 'low', 'on', 'all', 'very', 'are', 'real']",1.0,"Quick summary: all countries print money, and this has lead to asset inflation. Then there's also, lower corporate tax rates, lower interest rates, higher valuation multiples, lower supply of new stocks due to the way private equity works, ponzi-like 401K and IRA programs, loans on portfolio values allowing increased leveraging, etc.

Longer version:

In my opinion, it has nothing to do with actual value, at least not directly. Just supply and demand of money and stocks.

The US is the primary world reserve currency. When any other country prints money, they hold a certain percentage of US Dollars too, so that they have some power to sell the dollars and buy their own currency if their economy weakens and their currency follows. What this means is that as other nations print-to-infinity (everybody's doing it), they hoard more and more dollars. This ongoing demand for USD makes the dollar very strong, which makes it easier to outsource to these weaker currency nations for products, which then gives American companies outstanding margins. But these other countries don't just hold the USD as USD, they hold them as Treasury bonds, which keeps our interest rates low, which then allows US companies to leverage buybacks and growth.

When the Fed prints money, they are also buying bonds. This is known as QE. When banks sell these bonds, the banks then use this cash to buy more bonds from the Treasury, and this re-equilibrates into equities and all assets. So when the Fed prints money, it is called QE and increases the USD money supply and the price of USD assets. Because the USD is the world reserve currency, when other countries print money, it doesn't increase the supply of USD, but it does increase demand for USD assets.

In USA, unlike many other countries, we don't have a full pension program, so we set up a ponzi system known as IRAs and 401Ks. People put a percentage of their paychecks into these programs, which have relatively few options for investment, and most just goes blindly into SP500. In other countries, major incentives are in place to take out loans and buy housing, but not necessarily to buy stocks. If stock investment was about real value, investors would be buying European stocks, but they haven't done that.

Over the last decade, corporate tax rates in USA have come down. Valuation multiples have expanded greatly. Private equity and rigged governmental subsidies and donations have made fewer small cap stock listings and allowed never-before-seen growth of megacaps.

Can all of this continue? Should it?"

for example, i'm going to tell you we're in a bubble right now. it will pop within the next 2 years. what can you do?

&#x200B;

1. hold cash- earn 5%, lose \~3% to inflation, and miss out on any upside in the next 2 years, and it crashed to a drop of 10% higher from here

&#x200B;

2) buy puts to profit off the bubble burst- bubble didn't burst until the 23rd month and didn't drop that much so your puts are OTM- still a loss

being wrong and being early is exactly the same thing. there's nothing you can do about a bubble burst. i'm confident there are still people from 08 who are still waiting for the market to burst so they can buy"

1124,The S&P 500 could be severely overpriced,2024-03-23 19:20:27,39.0,"I thought it was funny that there's a bunch of complaints about frequent S&P 500 posts, so here's mine.

My base scenario:

The S&P 500 is currently priced to return approximately 5 to 5.5%. This is assuming 2% growth, the same level of corporate taxes now going into the future, and a base of the TTM operating earnings. If you were to hold the S&P 500 and never sell, you would realize this yield over the long term. The problem now is that you can get this same yield by buying short-term treasury bills without taking any added risk. What are the odds that corporate taxes stay at 21%? I find it hard to believe that they won't go higher considering the federal deficit will likely require higher tax revenue in the future.

Sure, true. It definitely isn't cheap

Whats funny about having a thoughtful discussion? The thing is, the bear narrative always seems more intellectually appealing. It makes the bulls look like ignorant normies while the bears are the only ones seeing the real flaws in the economy. Despite me being very much a victim to this mindset at the start of my investment journey, the reality is: ""a bull market climbs a wall of worry""

> My base scenario:

> The S&P 500 is currently priced to return approximately 5 to 5.5%. This is assuming 2% growth,

Despite ""GDP Growth Rate in the United States averaged 3.20 percent from 1947 until 2023"" ok

> the same level of corporate taxes now going into the future, and a base of the TTM operating earnings. If you were to hold the S&P 500 and never sell, you would realize this yield over the long term. The problem now is that you can get this same yield by buying short-term treasury bills without taking any added risk. 

Wrong. The difference between a bond yield and an earnings yield is that the earnings yield compounds while the bond yield does not. While you talk about short term risk free rates, you are running the ""risk"" of having even more unfavourable investment opportunities at maturity (lower yields and more expensive stocks). The difference is that earnings yield compounds without this reinvestment risk. 

> What are the odds that corporate taxes stay at 21%? I find it hard to believe that they won't go higher considering the federal deficit will likely require higher tax revenue in the future. Suffice it to say that any of this can cause a big principal loss.

The question then is could you hold stocks through a 50% drawdown?

This is incredibly one dimensional. Corporate taxes affect every aspect of economic health, from bond repayment capacity to earnings yield to unemployment and offshoring. If the government decided to bump taxes up 100% overnight, obviously it would not be good for equity prices. Yet, the long term implications: moving production offshore, decreased real economic investment and employment, etc. Are the exact reason why the federal deficit is expanding in the first place. The US is trying deperately to maintain production independence in a plethora of markets even while it is not necessarily economic to do so. Your thesis is literally: ""they will spend more public funds while removing the private incentives""

?? Not even sure how to refute this one. Yes returns can be negative for extended periods of time (the trick is to keep buying, as you're nearly guaranteed to profit in the long run. At least, the odds are much much much higher than yours are in terms of timing the market. In fact, if you're a net buyer, your optimal scenario is a short term market crash. No need to pray for the optimal scenario while staying uninvested). People definitely are aware of this risk. Im not sure you've talked to anyone who was invested in the 2000's or 2008 but those people were positively traumatised and lost all hope in markets.

Where did you get a 2% growth number? Most big tech are expected to grow more than this and they make up a large portion of the S&P now.

This assumes that when corporate taxes are raised (which I agree with BTW), that t-bills will continue to yield their current amount. IMO, it's much more likely tbills will drop before corporate taxes are raised.

ppl dont realize usa is not the only 1 printing money

if u combine money printing from all the other countries, financial condition atm is getting close to the peak of covid bubble era (extremely loose)

just look at this very recent case

mstr borrows $800million at 0.625% with convertible bonds

financial condition is tighten only at the low end for poor ppl like u n me

money is overflowing like a crude oil bursting from the ground for rich/some what sizeable businesses n ppl r still willing to lend monies at extremely low interest rate to the guys at higher up

japan recently raised interest rate from -0.1% to WHOPPING '0%' wow such big

china is printing money like no tomorrow

swiss lowering interest rate, etc

ppl dont realize there is just too much money around the world

goods inflation goes down cause countries r producing more and product demands r met / lowering

but there is limited asset to buy for lots of money out there

ppl dont realize usa is not the only country in the world and there is 100+ countries with money printer keeps going BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

ofc, usa has the best economy atm with one of the highest interest rate (probably highest for developed country) so it's obvious moneies will concentrate on usa and become overpriced but overpriced is the new norm

in normal circumstance, value of other countries' currencies will drop like a rock until they can at least match or exceed usa's interest rate but u know governments manipulate the currencies

usa stock being expensive = it's like normal price ok? good things never trade at cheap price

if I were to guess about interest rate future, my bet is that usa will be the last to decrease rate.

countries with weak/poor economies will be the first to lower interest rate first

usa will absorb all the money printings from other countries without side effect of money printing.

usa stock market will hit all time high every yr. so usa can keep strong economy + while maintaining somewhat high interest rate as buffer. when usa economy starts to weaken, it'll lower interest rate little bit to boost economy even further

yes lots of current usa stock valuations are expensive but next yr, my guess is it'll be even more expensive than it is now

imo, some of faang stocks r actually cheaper in value wise than the small-mid cap stock atm due to their growth and earning potential. it's been like that for like several months already

Scenario 1: bond yields go to zero, tomorrow.

Result: long term bonds will instantaneously spike (F for short term bond holder though). Yet, equities, being extremely long duration assets will spike far higher. This leaves bond holders with one option for compounding: buying much more expensive equities by selling their bonds. 

Scenario 2: inflation goes up to 100% due to money printing

Both, with a bias towards practical experience. But this is a natural tendency of my character and learning style. I am an active experimenter.

In options trades, the market price is frequently way out of line. If you didn't have a practical basis in trading there you would trade at a very wrong price.

There are a lot things happening under the hood with investing. How markets and market makers actually function is something that I am continually learning. I've read a few books on investing now. I haven't seen a book yet on these sort of mechanistic market functions. That doesn't mean there isn't one.

1218,ETFs don't make sense if you are a value investor,2024-03-22 01:58:35,42.0,"This is a controversial opinion I wanted to share. Let me know your thoughts..

Does it make any sense to buy an ETF as a value investor?  
  
Here is my reasoning for this: 

What is value investing? Buying a company at fair price or below, act like an owner and not a trader, and know what you own. This means being in a position to know what the company is worth, by estimating its future cash flow from now to judgment day. How do you value a company? There are quantitative measures, of course, like p/e, p/fcf, etc, which are readily available for ETFs, too. However the qualitative aspect is also pivotal. I list some principles inspired by Munger and Buffett:  


1. To invest you need to know and trust that the management has integrity and that their incentives are aligned with yours.

2. To invest you have to stay in your circle of competence, to be able to assess the business fundamentals of the company, its moat, and endurance. That means not investing in sectors you have no clue about, or in companies whose product you can barely decipher.

3. Value is not price. Mr Market is a lunatic and he should serve us, not the other way around. In particular, risk is not a function of volatility. In fact, if something drops in price ceteris paribus it is less risky, despite beta being higher. 

4. Only one kind of information should guide our investment decisions: what is relevant and knowable. Macro is not knowable, so we should largely ignore it.  
  
Now, looking at all these principles, if you are a value investor how does it make sense sense to invest in an etf, especially the most popular ones which are (a) broadly diversified and (b) market weighted? For:  


*  You can't trust the management of the companies you own, because ETFs have hundreds of companies in them, how can you possibly do due diligence on the management of each of them?

* If the ETF is broadly diversified, it invests in sectors you have no clue about, so you are not staying in your circle of competence.

* Most ETFs are based on what the market thinks: they are market cap weighted (b). Which means that, by definition, they just follow what Mr market thinks of a sector/company. VT is 64% US equities, for example.

* If a company drops a lot for no reason, if the ETF is market cap weighted (b), the company's weight is diminished, not boosted. If it rises beyond any reasonable expectation, the ETF will follow. A year ago Nvidia was 1.8& of the S&P, now it is over 5%. 

* This is more controversial, but I feel that if you invest in a sector or in a broadly diversified index, the variables that matter most of all are all macro-economic ones: interest rates, fed-policies, politics, macro-economic trends etc. So the result of the investment is relying on information you cannot predict.

Conclusion: ETFs don't make any sense, from a value-investing perspective.

How does investing in ETF (or technically indexing) promises safety of principal and adequate return? Yes, the US has historically gone up but then there's Japan and other countries that's gone down for long time.

You are too narrowly defining value investing. It's not just one thing, one style. Even ones that fit your bill are different Graham vs Buffet(When broken down Buffett isn't even a value investor his returns are much more attributable to the quality factor than value).

Basically, you are picking a single kind of value investing and then saying it's the only true style of value investing, which is just not true. The style you discuss isn't even the *original* definition/traditional style of value investing! (Graham). Hence why the sub tagline is that it's a sub for *all* kinds of value investing.

There is top-down and bottom-up style value investing. You are talking bottom-up, basing off fundamentals and thinking you can run DCF models and such better than other market participants. Top-down is different, where a universe of stocks are sorted by metrics which allows you to filter them down into sub-universes. For value, that's P/E,P/B, and often paired with profitability/quality measures. And then investing in those ~10-30% of equities that are best in those measures.

** accidental graphic is from the link from adidas ceo saying that China was recovering.. 

Regarding Nike, today’s news wasn’t unexpected as the warnings (Sam Poser from Williams Trading) came as early as last week that the company was gonna miss. 

Actually the numbers wasn’t so bad, sales was flat and earning beat, that US and China sales were up was unexpected (Europe and Converse were down),  and it caused an initial bump up of the share price.

But the share price dropped 5-6% AH when the company forecasted that fy2025 was going to be soft in the first half and sales was going to decline by single digit in 1H and only pick up only in 2nd half of fy2025. 

Well it sounds terrible until you realise that Nike’s financial year is from June to May, which means that the calendar year 2024 is a Zzzz year while they try and fix the problem.

I will probably sit tight with my 0.5% portfolio of Nke and buy some more after the swoon.

I see a couple of catalysts here:

- Paris Olympics. 
- Continued business recovery in China. ( adidas ceo [commented](https://www.ft.com/content/d1bf3d32-176f-4110-a04d-4448268d1946) last week he was bullish on China) 

Regarding Lulu, they fell 10% AH due to guidance. The difference between the two is that Nike has been falling all of last year while the inverse is true for Lulu.

I will do some DD on Lulu later today, I want to be convinced that Lulu isn’t a fad and more of a lifestyle choice like Nike. 

TLDR: if you don’t buy high quality companies when they are cheap, then when do you buy them? Our job, as value investors is to check and see if the problem is temporary or a permanent impairment of the business.

I have felt like we are in a soft landing for awhile now and this further supports it, I follow a bunch of industrial and retail companies and guidance is flat across the board, the exception has been certain retailers that offer needs as opposed to wants. 

I don't like Lulu and I am glad they're down and I hope they go down more, it's a personal opinion based thing and don't expect anyone to agree, if more people were like me the company wouldn't exist but that's obviously not the case. They sell fabrics for giant markups made by impoverished people in poor living situations, yet it's consumers are convinced it's a symbol of status and will tell you it's because they're comfortable and great quality which is true but not the main reason it's purchased. You can buy equivalents from Costco for a fraction of the price that are equally as comfortable and durable, still made by cheap labour though. I could get behind paying $100-200 for pants if I know the quality is good and it took someone 2-4 hours to put together, but not an impoverished person in Asia pumping out dozens per hour, for that I'd pay far less (I never said I'm a good person). Chip Wilson said consumer spending habits are changing, the demographic that buys their clothing is more pinched by raising rates and is typically more indebted, these groups are probably coming to the realization that more pricey brand names aren't great for your pocket. Same dude has one of the largest impacts in my city for the cost of living crisis which is fueled by the mantra that is contrary to value, I got lucky and got in early but he owns 5000 or so units in my city where the average detached home is 3m (2.2m USD), helping screw over most future generations."

I'm not sure if they ever officially came out and said. I think at a certain point, they just stopped mentioning it. They said they estimated it would cost them $10B in revenue in 2022 (then never updated that number). They mentioned targeting and conversions would be an issue. Conversion they hoped to address quickly and targeting would take a few years. From what I can gather, they just learned to do more with less data. Their Cost of Revenue went from \~18% in 2020, to 19% in 2021 (partial ios impact), to 22% in 2022 (full ios impact), back down to 19% in 2023.

They're also finding ways to get around GDPR by offering European users the choice between a subscription service (w no ads or tracking) or an ads based service (with tracking). Im guessing Europe will find some way to sue over that. (They always do)

This is not true. Perhaps on an absolute basis, metaverse spending was cut, just because they laid off 20,000 people. But on a relative basis, they are still spending a shit ton on the Metaverse.

From what I understand, the only thing the 'Do Not Track' button does is that it stops your device from sharing the identifier for advertisers (IDFA) which is a unique serial number attached to each device that can be used to track user activity across different apps. But, apps can still collect lots of other information: your IP address, your device specs, your location etc. which is enough to create a unique blueprint for any user. This is supposedly against Apple's ToS but their enforcement is lax. So ultimately, I think the feature is just privacy theater and doesn't meaningfully affect the data these apps can collect.

My girlfriend and dad both allowed Meta tracking them on their iOS devices when I  checked.. they didn't even know they allowed and barely know what tracking is.

Meta also said something about investing heavily in AI to deliver more relevant ads with less data.

Its hard to say what they actually turned around or what just became new growth. They stagnated for 1,5 years or so, but so did other companies. Then they grew insanely fast last quarter out of nowhere..

Who knows without the 30% of iOS users opting out of tracking they would have grown even more. Or the online ad market just grew a lot? 

The thing also is, online advertisers didnt really have another platform to go to anyway. So they kinda have to pay Meta anyway.. Meta has a serious monopoly because millions of people can't be targeted anywhere else than TV or through Meta apps ads. 

And as last, when Meta did stagnate in revenue (at the same time Apple updated that iOS), companies were also in general afraid for a recession and used less on marketing, so it looked like it was really hitting them more than it did i think."

1411,Booking Holdings is still seems to be trading at a discount,2024-03-21 15:00:26,47.0,"Booking Holdings is one of those companies consistently underestimated by Wall Street. It outperforms the benchmarks and has a great growth outlook, yet it trades at a cheap valuation and significant discount to Airbnb. 

I mean, this company is projected to grow its top line by high single digits and EPS by over 15% for the foreseeable future, yet it trades at just 20x earnings. For perspective, Airbnb, which has a similar growth outlook, is valued at over 30x earnings for both this year and the next fiscal year and trades at a PEG of 2.5. This is far ahead of Booking’s discounted PEG of 1.12, which is just ridiculous and a 27% discount to the sector median.

The only real reasons for this are a perceived weak moat and economic sensitivity, but the company has proven over decades that it is well able to grow through cycles and has so far proven well able to maintain customers, even in the face of significant competition. 

On top of this, the company is one of the best in terms of returning cash to shareholders, lowering the share count by 9% in 2023 alone. It has now also introduced a dividend, making it one of the most compelling dividend growth stocks out there. 

I have discussed all these factors in depth right here on my Substack: [https://rijnberkinvestinsights.substack.com/p/booking-holdings-inc-now-a-terrific](https://rijnberkinvestinsights.substack.com/p/booking-holdings-inc-now-a-terrific)

Here’s a metric for ya booking.com bulls:

Pre pandemic, earnings was growing between 15-17% a year for the last 5-6years. Eps was higher and closer to 20% (This is known) 

Analysts are currently forecasting earnings per share  to grow between 16-20% a year for the next 5 years. (This is estimated) 

Currently the share price is only being valued as a 10-12% EPS growth (based on a discount rate of 9%, and a starting eps of 117.4)

I bought ABNB in Nov. last year at 129, admitedly because I didn't know a lot of their earnings were one time tax incentive based (or something like that, I posted about it here and learned). Their margins and growth are pretty great still, but since the run up I'm considering closing the position. I like others like V, META, or GOOGL at this type of high valuation.

Eps/revenue etc. are all predetermined numbers. They aren't real. Fake to please the lot who called investor relations. 

Booking.com for now is a solid firm; but it's supply pool (hotels) is seeing their margins (net profit margin decline) due to a fucked up housing market worldwide with shit like Airbnb etc. 

So brick and mortar 

- like hotels on booking.com will become more expensive because environmental reasons will press margins, competitors

- booking.com has the advantage of a wide supply pool worldwide so if a economy in the west doesn't do well in the east it might not. 

Bottom line they earn.

But they are a extremely vanilla business that just came right time right place. 

Hotels will seek and invent more (interactive daughters chains) - like f1 simulators close to a track. They won't book this through booking.com because the supply pool who goes there picks the cheaper solutions.

* Hotels will innovate and sell packages through events
* Firms like Airbnb will get more and more struggling issues due to the issue of people. 30yrs still living at home

Both are at booking.com

Booking.com will slim down and simply use the shit cheap west to east (known) for it's hostels and 1-2-3 hotels so trigonometry wise it will keep earning money but it's net profit margin (how much profit after tax % out of 1€ revenue will decline (but not become negative)).

This is a firm on its decline. One to stay with us; but the big bucket with cash and earning (more) than expected will never happen again.

Therefore filtering on ""metrics"" is silly.

Think. 

If you adjust the metrics for this info you get a ""fair valuation"". While now it deceives to look cheap. 

It isn't.

It will only become interesting if they vertically innovate their cashflow. Like they help (customer - airline - taxi) = sum costs to decline by providig tailored insurances for examples."

1472,One thing no one seems to mention about Warren...he's a savant. Possibly an autistic savant.,2024-03-20 18:40:45,51.0,"This post isn't about an investing prospect, but about the man who's been the #1 investing teacher to all of us, Warren E. Buffett. I've watched a lot of his interviews and annual shareholder meetings. He's endlessly personable, folksy, and charismatic. That's why he draws such huge crowds. 

I've also read the Lowenstein biography, and right now I'm 300 pages into the Alice Schroeder biography. And at that point in the biography, Warren's just about 35....Alice spends a lot of time on his early years, much more than Roger Lowenstein did. 

And the Warren in those books is a little different than the Warren we see on stage. The first thing that jumps out at you is his IQ. The Warren we see on stage is really smart. The Warren in the biographies is really, really, REALLY smart. On stage, he constantly downplays his mental abilities. But exaggerated modesty is part of his schtick, and his charm. 

And Warren is not just really smart, smart, if that makes sense. It's more than that. It's never labeled explicitly in the books, but it's clear that Warren has savant syndrome. He might even be classified as an autistic savant, though that's harder to diagnose.

His mathematical ability is the first thing that obviously stands out. Warren says he's never owned a calculator, because he doesn't need one. He can manipulate large numbers in his head in just seconds, or faster. And by manipulate, it's not multiplication and division, but fairly complicated formulas like a CAGR return. 

I've only found one video of him doing this in person, and it's a comparatively minor feat (though still impressive), and here it is:

[https://youtu.be/mmcasm-sG0Y?t=330](https://youtu.be/mmcasm-sG0Y?t=330)

Just his ability to perform calculations in his head already puts him in the savant realm. Normal humans can't do that stuff. But his abilities go beyond that. 

Again the books never label this, but they give examples of an eidetic memory. For instance, in HS and college, Warren just read all the books he felt he needed to read before the year started, and he was apparently done studying for the year. From then on, he could recall their contents from memory, and would show off by correcting his teachers if they misquoted a textbook.  

His memory for numbers, in particular, is even more impressive, and again can only be described as superhuman. There are multiple accounts of his ability to consume absolutely massive amounts of numbers and recall any particular one instantly. He'd read though thousands and thousands of pages of the Moody's manuals and if you named a company from those pages and asked for the basic financials, he could recite them to you right away. 

The last bit of evidence to mention, and it's amazing the biographies didn't harp on this a little more, was his precociousness. Warren was a prodigy. He was reading college-level investing books when he was 7. Seven. Most kids at that age can't even read a book, any book. 

One thing that's interesting to note, or at least interesting to me, is that as I've made my way through these biographies, I do see a lot of parallels between Warren and another popular fictional genius. And that's the Big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper. In fact, that's how I've been describing Warren to friends and family who don't follow him like I do. ""He's Sheldon Cooper, but single-mindedly obsessed with business instead of physics.""

Some of the parallels: they have, I think, about the same IQ. There's the eidetic memory, of course. They both love trains and doing their own taxes, although Sheldon started that even earlier than Warren (6 vs.14). They both love their routines and repetition. They both need taken care of outside of their work. (Both biographies say that, for Susie, being married to Warren is like having another child to take care of.) And they have an at-time rude self-centeredness, a focus on what they see as ""theirs"". 

There are a number of examples of this in the biographies, but one of the most extreme ones would be Warren's train set. When he's in his 30s, one of Warren's investors builds him an enormous, amazing train set in the attic of his Farnam street house. Warren's children are at the perfect ages to delighted and captivated by this train set, which was something Warren always wanted as a child. But the train set is HIS, and *the children aren't allowed near it.*

That's about it for this post. My point in writing it is to say that, for all we talk about Warren, you never hear discussed just how truly, mind-blowingly intelligent he is. And he has a lot of signs that point towards autism (more than I've mentioned here), though that's not certain. Interestingly, that same ""is he or isn't he autistic"" is hotly debated about the other character mentioned here, Sheldon. 

And if I'd had the good fortune to read these biographies back when they came out, I'd have just invested all my money with him. Truly, he's a remarkable individual.

Unless I'm mistaken, most kids in an upper-middle class American household learn how to read by 7.  Half my classmates had read Harry Potter by then (not particularly difficult admittedly, but still).

His achievements certainly betray extreme intelligence but not all of them are as unusual as you make them out to be.

Doing taxes at 14—Most kids have a job at 15–16. I certainly did. Guess who did my taxes?

Not letting his children play with a train set—My dad has a couple of old comic books he treasures. Some are from his childhood (primarily Tintin and Asterix) and some are vintages (is that the word?) he purchased recently (lots of Avengers). I wasn't allowed to read any back when I was a kid. My dad isn't autistic.

Mental calculations—I competed in math competitions from 12—17. I'm neither autistic nor a savant. All the kids I knew serious about competitions tried to get better at arithmetic to A) mildly improve our speed in contests and B) to look smarter (mostly the latter). One of the exercises many of us did was prime factorize license plates when we sat in cars. Do that for a year and you get pretty good at division and unintentionally memorize many, many primes. Till today, I'm  good enough at arithmetic that I can convince someone I'm extremely intelligent and mathematically gifted. In reality, I almost got held back in 1st grade for an inability to do addition and I'm an idiot. I'd envision one can get good at arithmetic in much the same way: practice."

I found out about Warren Buffett in the mid-1980's and have continuously held Berkshire Hathaway shares (and started going to the annual meeting) since the early 1990's.  I've met Warren more than a half-dozen times and have met both of his sisters.  I, too, consider him to be a genius/savant and I can vouch for Warren's ability to perform complex calculations in his head and his ability to recall facts and figures; I saw it first-hand.  (I can't share the details, it might be enough to dox me.)

Warren's sisters are extraordinarily intelligent (his older sister passed away in 2020).  I'm no slouch (National Merit Scholar and Mensa), but I had to be at the top of my game to stay in conversations with both of them.

I'm not sure that Warren is on the spectrum, but it's no secret that there were other potential genetically inheritable issues (especially on his mother's side of the family).  There are some who consider his mother's brother to be the precursor to Warren:

I don’t think it’s just the IQ that made Buffett great. He would probably point to his temperament. The intellectual curiosity and interest are pretty important. He also approached investing with a combination of academic rigor and practicality that is pretty unique. He also had a lot of risk tolerance and a talent for sizing bets.

There’s lots of wildly intelligent, mildly autistic people in finance but not all of them make money. Fischer Black was one of the smartest people of the 20th century. I’d wager he probably had a few IQ points on Buffett. But he never succeeded in making much money on his own. Eventually Goldman hired Black and made oodles of money off of his ideas.

But anyways he kept this going from age 10, and the curiosity bug never left him. Studying the greats before him like Graham, and Dod  etc. 

He and Charlie also discussed an early partner that left the firm , and burned out chasing excessive returns essentially. Warren and Charlie said this partner was just as smart as them, but the greed and lack of risk management leading to them blowing up. Essentially Warren and Charlie said they knew they would get ri ch eventually, largely via compounding. But this partner wanted to be rich tomorrow. And it caused them to crash and burn.

Half my classmates had read Harry Potter by then (not particularly difficult admittedly, but still).

I'm the head of an upper-middle class household, and have a couple kids who are at the top of their classes. 7-year-olds can read, but not generally real books. It is the age when reading skill typically improves drastically, and a 7 year 0 month old kid can be at a drastically different level than a 7 year and 9 month old kid.  But reading college-level investing books? That's extremely rare.

>I'd envision one can get good at arithmetic in much the same way: practice.

Company A has gross revenues of $5,190,500,000 in 1996 against expenses of $2,672,250,000, and in 2013 has gross revenues of $26,490,200,000 against expenses of $18,670,450,000. What's the CAGR of their gross and net profits?

That's a big part of why I found the biographies so surprising.

A couple notes. First, both he and Charlie have commented on how they've matured over the years, especially past middle-age. They've described themselves as being  ""quite annoying,"" or something like that, before 40 or 50.

Second is the influence of Dale Carnegie on Warren, as recounted in the AS biography. Warren took to ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as a manual on how to act. He didn't just take Carnegie's word for it, though. According to Alice, he rigorously A-B tested the advice, recorded the results, and ran a regression analysis on the results of using Carnegie's method. That's....unusual.

And if you've seen one of the videos of Warren's office tours, you'll note his Dale Carnegie certificate is still framed prominently in his office, all these decades later. Warren has frequently mentioned how the course changed his life. He doesn't mention the book as much, but from the biography, that had at least as much impact if not more."

Well, two. The first girl Warren dated was totally nuts, and still, according to Charlie, he almost got married to her. But then he finally got Susie out on some dates and very quickly proposed. In this case, he's Wolowitz, not Sheldon.

Ideally, labeling is an academic shorthand that helps us build on existing experience. Instead of saying “cannot understand emotions but has an extraordinary talent for mathematics”, we can say patient exhibits similar cases of ASD (non-derogatorily) and look at similar cases of ASD to determine treatment and regulate symptoms. 

The problem is when people:
1. Over label things that are opaquely defined and shouldn’t be labeled (a lot of economics IMO and some would argue psychiatry as well) or the labeler is unqualified to diagnose and mistreats as a result. 
2. Labeling things for the sake of labeling and doing nothing productive with the label. Like so what if Buffett is autistic or a savant? Do we use that knowledge to better understand our own circles of competence with respect to Buffett’s? Can we use Buffett’s experiences to help ASD patients function effectively in society? Or do we just use that label to sound smart / feed our defeatist attitudes and give up on doing due diligence because we feel like only savants can crunch so many numbers? 
3. Judging others based on labels. He’s autistic; therefore, that takes away from his accomplishments. This is problem 2 but taking it one step further really.

Not saying OP is necessarily doing these things, but I think it’s important to know why we label so that we can label with healthy intention."

Took me 3 minutes in my head to do profits. Retraced thought process below with approximate time per step:

5,190,500,000-2,672,250,000 = 2,518,250,000 (10 seconds)

26,490,200,000 - 18,670,450,000 = 7,819,750,000 (10 seconds)

781,975/251,825 \~ 3.1 (10 seconds)

3.1\^(1/(2013-1996))=3.1\^(1/17) (5 seconds)

Using Newton's method:

x\^17=3.1 (5 seconds)

Guess x=1:

1 - (1\^17 - 3.1)/(17 \* 1\^16) = 1 + 2.1/17 \~ 1.1 (10 seconds)

x = 1.1 - (1.1\^17 - 3.1)/(17\*1.1\^16) (10 seconds)

= 1.1 - (1.1\^17 - 3.1)/(1.1\^17 \* 17 /1.1)  (5 seconds)

= 1.1 - ~~(1.1\^17)/(1.1\^17)~~ \* 1.1/17 + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16)  (5 seconds)

\~ 1.1 - 0.065  + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16)  = 1.035 + 3.1/(17\*1.1\^16) (10 seconds)

1.1\^16=1.21\^8\~1.45\^4\~2.1\^2\~4.4 (20 seconds)

1.035 + 3.1/(17\*4.4) (negligible)

\~1.035 + 3.1/75 (5 seconds

\~1.035 + 1/25 = 1.035 + 0.04= 1.75 (5 seconds)

1.075 - (1.075\^17-3.1)/(17\*1.075\^16) (timing basically same as above)

= 1.075 - 1.075/17+3.1/(1.075\^16\*17)

\~ 1.075 - 0.06 + 0.18/(1.075\^16)

= 1.069 + 0.18/(1.075\^16)

1.075\^16\~1.17\^8\~1.4\^4\~1.9\^2\~3.6

=1.075 - 0.06+0.18/3.6

Which yields a CAGR of 6.5, just 6% low.

I maintain my opinion that he's far more intelligent than you or me, but this feat is by no means superhuman. I could probably cut down to 40 seconds given the obvious shortcuts I missed and my slowness in arithmetic if I put in work for two years. If I memorized powers of 1.07 since that's the average growth rate for many metrics, it would take all of 5 seconds. He's still much faster, but I've met several people who would be capable of sub-20 seconds calculations with practice. He's a genius, yes, but this specific feat isn't so brilliant you'll never meet anyone capable of doing it.

Regarding the reading thing, I can't claim to be a parent or upper-middle class : ( However, reading at a college level, even if not investing textbooks in particular, is still common enough. It's as much an interest issue as it is a difficulty issue. Speaking from personal experience, my mother learned English at 4 and was reading Dickens at 10 (which is high school level, arguably, but she did have a disadvantage). I'm a native speaker and read her copy of War and Peace at 9—the difficulty is exaggerated in popular culture but it's still best read at ages 17+—because I was curious what the fat book occupying half a shelf was about. I didn't understand everything, but that's because I'm not as intelligent as Buffet. I've met many people who were capable of such achievements at 7."

1557,Thoughts on ACLS? - Long Position Thesis,2024-03-21 05:23:01,54.0,"**I. Business Overview**

Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (ACLS) specialises in designing, manufacturing, and servicing ion implantation and processing equipment for semiconductor chip fabrication. The Purion product line is preferred by leading semiconductor chip manufacturers worldwide. In 2023, 98.3% of ACLS’ revenue came from the ion implantation business, with the remaining 1.7% generated from aftermarket sales of legacy processing systems. 

Despite industry downturn, 2023 proved to be a remarkable year for ACLS. Thanks to the strong demand for their products and aftermarket support, ACLS achieved record revenue of $1,130.6 million and record earnings per share of $7.43.

&#x200B;

**II. Industry & Competition**

**-** ***Industry:***I will not bore you with unnecessary details in a well known industry, however, integrated circuits, commonly referred to as semiconductor chips, serve an ever-expanding array of consumer and industrial applications as technology progresses.

**-** ***Competition:***ACLS and Applied Materials (AMAT) stand as the sole manufacturers offering a comprehensive spectrum of ion implant systems; and as ACLS put it in their 10-K, there are also “non-U.S. suppliers \[that\] potentially hold an edge over their U.S. counterparts due to newly implemented U.S. export controls, particularly concerning shipments to China.”

&#x200B;

**III. Income Statement**

The Income Statement and Balance Sheet sections will mostly include information available in documentation such as the 10-K as I wish to highlight some key information to the reader that will provide a clearer picture to my long position thesis. While I will add some insight, most of it will come in the ‘Thesis’ section.

In 2023, the profit margin reached 21.78%, marking a notable increase of 9.45% compared to the previous year. Accompanying this impressive margin, ACLS achieved record earnings per share of $7.43.

ACLS has a trailing P/E ratio of 14.96 and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.66.

The consensus estimate EPS for Q1'2024 is anticipated to be lower than the actual EPS for Q1'2023, 1.24 and 1.43 respectively; I believe ACLS’ EPS will beat expectations, putting my lower estimate at 1.26 and the 2024 EPS estimate at 7.21.

&#x200B;

**IV. Balance Sheet**

Both total assets and retained earnings have shown a consistent upward trend over the past four years, steadily growing in accumulation.

Despite substantial debt liabilities still accumulating in the past four years, net income has consistently risen at a commensurate rate during the same period. Moreover, in 2023, the accumulation rate of assets exceeded that of debt liabilities (debt-to-asset ratio at 32.53%), signalling a strengthened balance sheet poised to support growth initiatives in 2024.

&#x200B;

**V. Thesis**

**-** ***Backlog and Demand for ACLS Products:***As of December 31, 2023, ACLS' backlog, including deferred systems revenue, amounted to $1,211.6 million, signalling strong demand for its products and services. This substantial backlog reflects positively on ACLS' market position and the perceived value of its offerings.

**-** ***Insider Buying Activity:***Following a decline in share price during the summer of 2023, directors and officers at ACLS have resumed purchasing company shares, reflecting their confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Notably, the CEO of ACLS purchased shares on March 11th, marking the first such instance since 2022, further indicating a positive outlook for the company's performance.

**-** ***Financial Performance Comparison with AMAT:***In comparison to AMAT, ACLS demonstrates similar Return on Assets (ROA) values, indicating comparable asset utilisation efficiency. Despite this parity, ACLS has exhibited more robust quarterly earnings growth year over year, positioning it favourably within the semiconductor equipment industry. Additionally, ACLS boasts a higher book value per share than AMAT, yet trades at a substantially lower price, suggesting potential undervaluation relative to its financial metrics and market performance.

**-** ***Stock Price Movement and Market Sentiment:***Despite operating within the same sector and industry, ACLS and AMAT have experienced divergent stock price movements since July 2023. While insider selling within ACLS may have initially contributed to a downturn, positive factors such as the release of a flattering 10-K report, a large order backlog, and the already existing undervaluation relative to ACLS’ intrinsic value suggest a potential rebound in ACLS's stock price. These developments, coupled with ACLS's successful turnaround from an accumulated deficit in 2021 to high increases in year to year retained earnings, indicate improved financial performance and growth prospects for the company.

**-** ***Risk Analysis:***With a High Value at Risk (VaR) of 26.47% and a negative Sharpe ratio, I perceive the VaR to be overstated due to its susceptibility to the downturn observed since the summer of 2023, compounded by the fact that prices are lingering at the lower end of the 52-week price history. Regarding the Sharpe ratio, the elevated VaR obscures the equally high annualised return of 33.24%. These assessments are based on data spanning the past decade (2013-2023), with the VaR calculated using the Cornish-Fisher method.

&#x200B;

**VI. Risks**

Non-U.S. suppliers potentially hold an edge over their U.S. counterparts due to newly implemented U.S. export controls, particularly concerning shipments to China.

Occasionally, inventory surpluses within the semiconductor device industry result in an oversupply of semiconductors. This oversupply can lead to diminished demand for capital equipment, including ACLS’ products, thereby adversely affecting their sales and profitability levels. This inventory build-up is cyclical and hard to predict accurately.

With a High Value at Risk (VaR) of 26.47% and a negative Sharpe ratio, I perceive the VaR to be overstated due to its susceptibility to the downturn observed since the summer of 2023, compounded by the fact that prices are lingering at the lower end of the 52-week price history.

These assessments are based on data spanning the past decade, with the VaR calculated using the Cornish-Fisher method.

\- Strong 10-K and high order backlog- Undervaluation relative to its financial metrics and performance- Insider Buying

Please let me know your thoughts on any long position in ACLS or conversely, a short position. I have left out data easily accessible within investor relations' documentation such as the 10-K with the exception of the most pertinent data needed to provide a picture for the reader to understand the context behind the thesis.","['or', 'III', 'well', 'up', 'wish', 'key', 'beat', 'four', 'be', 'net', 'it', 'an', 'for', 'by', 'out', 'me', 'any', 'on', 'has', 'Both', 'add', 'hard', 'ever', 'are', 'AMAT', 'VII', 'can', 'you', 'ACLS']",,

I will add some visualisation to the quantitative risk analysis:

I used a stock scanner to compile an index of a few companies (low P/E, >25% EPS Growth Y-to-Y, etc). With this index then I ran a model to calculate the following values.

As you can see the highest VaR of the index belongs to ACLS. I did mention in the main post why I believe this value is misleading.

[https://imgur.com/a/dFlh7q0](https://imgur.com/a/dFlh7q0)

Here are the annualised returns for the index over the same time period. Notice how ACLS tops the index once again but by an even higher margin.

[https://imgur.com/a/neCPCV5](https://imgur.com/a/neCPCV5) 

I then used the model to construct an efficient frontier that can determine the ideal portfolio at the tangent with the market line. I assumed the risk-free rate to be 4.25%, the long-term average rate of the 10 Year Treasury Rate (I:10YTCMR).

[https://imgur.com/a/EXhvhek](https://imgur.com/a/EXhvhek)

Now here is the most peculiar thing; despite the negative Sharpe ratio, ACLS still holds over 50% of the ideal portfolio weight. 2nd place goes to GNTX which holds the highest Sharpe ratio, the 2nd highest annualised returns and below average (comparative to the index compiled) VaR.

I cannot say I bring much insight within the semiconductor industry. My evaluations and positions are much more heavily influenced by quantifiable data, with a significant emphasis on stock price risk, rather than wider industry sentiment, but here are my two cents on it:

Financially the company is very healthy; long term debt does not pose an issue (even in the case of unfavourable results), and the same can be said for liquidity. They focus on R&D as well and have hundreds of patents, although I cannot provide technical insight into them.

The semiconductor industry is bullish now, and I think that many investors saw some ugly figures, risk wise, on ACLS' part and decided to shy away due to the high asking price of both the industry and ACLS, hence the downturn (insider selling did not help but they are buying again now, at least). Operations wise, ACLS is on par if not performing better than its main competitors despite a disappointing 2nd half of 2023 for investors; keep in mind the aggressive accumulation rate of retained earnings, however.

As for investing long-term, ACLS trades low enough and at a lower volume comparative to the market, such that the expected value of the investment is positive as to my estimation, which I provide in good faith but cannot vouch for the accuracy of third-party data gathered by me to reach this conclusion. To counter short-term volatility and get a more indicative price of the short-term market, averaging your cost-basis over a short span is viable.

The nature of the business, its customers, and the industry as a whole has the disadvantages of any industry intertwined with our global supply network; it's stuck in the middle of a power struggle, more specific to this case, the chip war between the US and the CCP as you said.

To the disappointment of my general investment theory, they are unquantifiable events. I believe semiconductors are hot and will stay hot unless US-China implications get too deep, at which point the entire technology sector will be affected. I got lucky with TSM early, but I wanted to increase my exposure to this market at a cheap price in relation to the industry. My belief is that ACLS has the fundamentals, a large order backlog reinforcing the value of its products, and the commitment to R&D to remain competitive and keep its leading position in ion implantation. This is my personal belief and concurrent with my investment circumstances specifically, however.

I'm sorry I cannot provide more information into the political aspect, but I shy away from political debates and theories without underlying data; not to say that I do not have opinions as anyone would. Tell me what you think are the assumed risks in this long position and its implications. One of the reasons I posted this here was to see if anyone has any unique insights on something I have neglected or entirely missed, or provide more information to strengthen my thesis."
1561,What to do next? (Career/Study),2024-03-21 13:45:39,55.0,"Hi all!  
I have a career/study-related question specific to my circumstances.  
So, currently I am set to graduate from BSc Management from a top London-based university, this July. Right now, I am taking a finance module (incl. corporate finance), but it is boring, to be honest. I love reading on value investing (I loved Pulak Prasad's book), choosing the right firm is kind of like a puzzle/challenge for me that 'has to be solved,' which I really enjoy.   
My initial idea was to go into an equity research/boutique IB role to train myself first and ""buy"" time to record my portfolio's performance. Actually, it was Mohnish Pabrai who advised me in a meeting at my school to create a separate brokerage account to record my performance.   
My objectives:  
I do not want to stuck in a place like Wall Street firms where nothing is about value in firms and it's just numbers and sales. I also don't know whether a finance entry-level job will be as boring as my corporate finance class. If yes, I'll honestly consider doing something else.   
   
Secondly, I love reading on all the interdisciplinary aspects related to value investing (it started after reading Poor Charlie's Almanack). Psychology, History, Evolution - I am just curious about the world and I don't want to be stuck in a simple role just sitting in front of a spreadsheet 12-16 hrs/day. I hate this kind of a life, so I have a dilemma.   
My options (right now) are:   
1) Find a job (finance or anything else, I don't know yet)  
2) Do a masters degree - but I also don't know in what, my best bet is Psychology or Behavioral Decision Science or Behavioral Economics, as it's all related to psychology.   
3) Other options, e.g. starting my own business or something else.  
   
The question is then - what do you all think about this?

1615,Brown Forman B shares $BF.B,2024-03-21 02:40:19,57.0,"This company popped up on the 52 week lows this week and i took a look.

Brown Forman, the makes of Jack Daniels whiskey/bourbon is a high quality, family-controlled business and is suffering from a global decline in spirit sales. This isn't a company specific problem as its larger peer Diageo has been experiencing world-wide challenges in sales as well.

**On being a high quality company:**

The company shares sells as a premium over Diageo (p/e of 26.04 vs 19.57)  and over MGPI (p/e 17.41).

I think it is a combination of:

+ higher efficiency ratios (BF has the highest ROE & ROIC among the three) and

+  conservative financial management  (Diageo has the highest Debt to Equity Ratio) and

+ free cash flow generation (highest FCF/Sales %)

But what truly makes this a very high quality stock is that this 154-year old company has been increasing its Dividends every year consecutively for the last 40 years.

**The company isn't without issues:**

- This is a family owned business, their voting A-shares are ill-liquid and their B-shares are what most people trade on, but B-shares don't get to vote,

- I don't really know what is the growth rate for the next two years since management dropped the ball during the q3 earnings call in early march. Sales is going to be flat from +3/+5, and operating income is going to be between 0 and +2.

-Historically, pre-covid, they did 7% cagr EPS growth, for the last 10 years, they did 5% cagr, in the last 5 years, the EPS cagr was only 3+%

- The dividend yield, while highest in the last 10 years (cheapest), is also quite low at 1.62%. The annualized growth rate is between   5.45% (last 5 years)  and 7.02% (year 10 years)

**How to think about investing in BF.B**

During Pandemic, sales from drinks establishment took a hit but was counter-balanced by more people drinking at home. Post pandemic, customers were hit with high inflation, reduced spending power, return to work.

So is the problem of declining sales a permanent impairment to the business? ie. Are people going to drink more alcohol  in the future or are more people going to give up alcohol like cigarettes  and lead a teetotaller or reduced alcohol lifestyle ? (Budweiser just had a year it would rather forget, in 2023 they experienced  17.5% decline in U.S. sales and a total decline in volume of 3.4%)

Now that DEO and BF are gearing up on marketing to drive sales, this is good for the long term, but the near term impact will be earnings. One silver lining is that the new Ready to Drink ""Jack and Coke"" is really doing well,  and is expected to go world-wide in April this year. It was announced and launched in 11 countries in 2022/2023  iirc. This RTD product is experiencing a higher 5% growth-rate.

I really dislike **time** as a catalyst, because it is so meh. But BF.B is at its cheapest now than it has ever been (see the tearsheet below), and it is cheap not because of mis-management.

If i have to make a bet, i bet that it will take two years for BF for the business to recover back to the long term 4% sales growth and 7% earnings growth, and the share price to go back up to $70 from the current price of $52 or 16% annualized for the next two years.

The no.1 risk i see in investing in this share is this: BF.B could be re-rated as a slow growth stock or maybe at most track like Diageo, especially since Diageo is also a dividend aristocrat (a company that increases it dividend annually for the last 25  years).

(disclosure: i bought a BF.B tracker stock yesterday at $52)

Here is a copy of my datasheet which i prepared yesterday: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnQu4-9EZY5NM18jiQcFOuSjPB3l-bmQ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnQu4-9EZY5NM18jiQcFOuSjPB3l-bmQ/view?usp=sharing)

this is just a simple one page pdf file with the data gleaned from several sources. i have blanked out the valuation method, but my numbers for the IV is between $57.59 and $43.10, blended using several methods. M\* has it at $59 while CFRA rates its as a HOLD with a 12 month target of $55.

1623,The DFCF Model,2024-03-21 05:23:20,58.0,"Hello all,

I am curious as how heavily you rely on your Discount Free Cash Flow Model to give you your price targets. I do realize that not one metric is the ""end all be all"" to a financial decision. I'm still new to using the DFCF Model (about 20 tickers new) and have been using it with some of my current holdings. I noticed some of the positions I have done due diligence on have much lower price targets then my previous analysis has given me. How much percentage of the DFCF Model results determines your final decision. Is it say 20%, 60%, weight of your decision. Is DFCF Model just as simple as P/B (aka take it with a grain of salt). I know were generating Future Free Cash Flows here but how much of that really determines future price?

Looking forward to hearing your experience with this.

Have a good day!

I typically use the same assumptions for things like the discount rate, so now I look a the P/FCF ratio and that tells me whether the stock is priced as if it's going to shrink, grow very slowly, or grow quickly. From there, it should be obvious whether it's mispriced according to my understanding of the company and its competitive advantage.

I keep the math simple intentionally so that I don't put too much weight on it. At the end of the day, what we're really trying to do with the math is predict the future, which isn't possible, so if I do a full Wall St/Damoradan style DCF that requires 9 tabs of an Excel spreadsheet and takes an entire afternoon, my brain wants to put a lot of weight on the number that I come up with.

You said you did about 20, I would do at least another few dozen, maybe 100 more, just to get familiar with all the moving parts and how they impact the final valuation. If you're at all good at math (and here I don't mean ""have a PhD in advanced math,"" I mean ""understand how multiplication and division are inverses of each other and how percents work""), you'll find some shortcuts that get you to within a few percent of those exacting calculations and, for investing, that's good enough to tell whether something is obviously mispriced and worth a longer look or not.

It has insane profit margins at 20% and has 3x revenue in about 4 years. All of its ratios point towards a significant discount and margin of safety, main threat to its price being that it is indeed just a fad and will not be able to keep its revenues.

I think sentiment has shifted a lot on CROX even in this subreddit. It's a fantastic company with a really strong brand, which is probably the only real moat you can have in this industry. Their cash flow relative to capex is absolutely insane, even compared to other shoe companies and like you said, they're cheap.

The ""fad"" element of their business has never bothered me. I think investors often don't understand that clothing fads are fundamentally different from, say, beanie babies. Clothing often become a part of a person's identity. For example, I got a pair of Asics running shoes in high school and, as an avid runner, have been buying them ever since and will never buy another brand. People become lifelong purchasers of these premium brands even after the ""fad"" dies down.

I also like that people buy Crocs for different reasons. My 10-year-old nephew buys them because his friends do and he likes the colors and design. My girlfriend who's a nurse buys them because they're comfortable and she's on her feet all day, as do all of the nurses she works with."

I believed in my analysis so bought them anyways.

They're value for a reason, market doesn't recognize the value you might find in objective numbers and metrics. Otherwise they would be fair priced. 



My advise, do you own analysis and if you find out you are contrarian,  sometimes thats a positive sign"

I do not think the margin of safety is good enough now but still quite bullish long term. The most important part for long term is if the kids like them, and they do. The Crocs brand is really strong and I do not think it will fade anytime soon. 

The problems are more around Hey Dude and it will cost them a lot if they do not manage to turn that ship around.

It was likely selling way too low because of fears on debt but that was ignoring the fact that they are paying down like 200 mil per quarter."

My response is that a fad doesn't just last for the last 18 years with growing revenue and higher than industry average profit margin.

Then they complain about hey dude acquisition and their enormous debt that they have to take on. But look at their debt pay down rate! On 3/31/2021 their debt is 2.8 bil. As of 12/31/2023, it's 1.37 bil. At this rate they're projected to be debt free at the mid to end of next year. And oh by the way, they are decreasing their share count by about 3% a year for the past 10 years. 

At today's PE of 10, it's still undervaluled. Fundamentally speaking, they are a lot more profitable than Skechers, Deckers, Nike, On, and etc. plus their shoes is literally just rubber, maybe costs about $5 max to make (injection molding is cheap) with no intensive labor involved. They are light weight and takes a lot less space to store than your traditional shoe boxes.

People say how other companies can just copy their rubber shoes. However, I've tried out a lot of them. No one makes Crocs that doesn't feel flimsy and smells bad after a day of wearing them. Only Crocs can make Crocs"

So observations responding to your qs:

1) cross-generational/ cross-activity appeal. “Uncool” olds buy them for comfort. They appeal to young with right partnerships and also comfort and also personalization; the stupid charms were genius. It’s possible that gen whatever is after alpha will have moved on.. but that’s a while away! They’re the perfect shoe to walk the dog… to garden.. to wear around camp… as a house slipper

2) yes repeat buying. They fill a unique niche similar to Birkenstocks but they’re cheaper and have wider appeal as a result. And easy to buy/repeat buy. (Similar market cap as birk which is significantly overvalued)

3) China market growth (if they can replicate the popularity of Arcteryx—a wayyyy more $$$ product, golden!), new designs (risk would be moving too far away from core but so far they’ve been good moves imo), and even if not hyped front and center, there is a strong base and immune from social media fadness

To calculate the present value
(PV) of the cash flows, we'll
discount each cash flow back to
its present value using the
provided discount rate and then
sum them up. Additionally, we'll
calculate the present value of the
perpetuity at the end of Year 5
using the correct formula.
Given:
Discount rate (r): 15%
Perpetual growth rate (g): 3%
Cash flows for each year: $20
million, $30 million, $15 million,
$25 million, $30 million
1. Discount each cash flow:
O Year 1: $20 million Y (1 +
0.15)^1 = $17.39 million
Year 2: $30 million / (1 +
0.15)^2 = $22.80 million
Year 3: $15 million / (1 +
0.15)^3 =$9.14 million
Year 4: $25 million /(1+
0.1 5)^4= $13.89 million
Year 5: $30 million (1 +
O
0.15)^5= $15.22 million
2. Calculate the present value of
the perpetuity at the end of
Year 5:
Perpetuity value =Year 5
cash flow/(1 +g)^n
Perpetuity value = $30
million / (1 + 0.03)^5
Perpetuity value = $30
million / 1.159274
O Perpetuity value u $25.88
million
3. Sum up the present values of
cash flows for years 1 to 5
and the present value of the
perpetuity:
◦ PV = $17.39 million +
$22.80 million + $9.14
million + $13.89 million +
$15.22 million + $25.88
million
PV z $104.32 million
So, the present value of the cash
flows is approximately $104.32

With what, LOL?  Debt doesn't get paid off with Revenue, it gets paid off with FCF.   
 At best, if they devote 100% of FCF to paydown of debt (after maintenance CapEx), and 0% to growth CapEx, they might be able to pay down 40% of the debt in the next 5 years.  But they've already made clear they will NOT be doing that b/c they intend to begin allocating some FCF to growth.  If they don't, Revenue will start shrinking.

The goal is to devote maximum FCF to debt paydown for the next 2 years, get the debt to equity down to 3.0, and then slow down debt paydown, and use that leverage to advantage as the debt is fixed at rates lower than they believe they can grow. It's a nice plan, but can they execute. Zaslov, on a pure performance basis, has been one of the most overpaid CEOs in the world over the last decade. He's also bungled and bumbled more things than not in this transition.

Value investing requires you to buy stocks at a discount large enough so that you have a margin of safety to protect against loss if your thesis doesn't play out.  
  
On the other hand, you can also have success by adhering to a growth investing philosophy. Growth investors will happily pay a premium for stocks if their growth potential is significant enough. If the stock is able to actually achieve those high levels of growth, the rewards can be significant... but, the lack of a margin of safety means that if for some reason that growth is not achieved, the stock has a very long way to fall.

Artificial intelligence is in a league of its own in terms of historical significance and potential value created.

Housing market trends are shaping up in favor of a solid 2024 for U.S. homebuilders — as long as mortgage rates don’t jump back to the highs they hit late last year. All the homebuilder sector analysts have increased their target price for homebuilders in anticipation of rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

With lower interest rates, homebuilders don't need to offer incentives anymore to bring the rates down and this will increase their profit margins immensely.

On the flip side, the advantage homebuilders have in high interest rate economy is they can cut in their profit margins and offer incentives to lower the rates to new home buyers. Historically, pre-COVID era, profit margins for homebuilders were between 18-20%, and right now they are between 22-24%, so they still have some room to attract new home buyers.

Lennar (LEN), Pulte (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) have established themselves as industry titans who offer more affordable entry level homes to first time homebuyers.

Everyone excepted a housing crash in 2022 because rates rose rapidly, so the builders became exceedingly cheap. Why didn't this happen? 1. Homeowners locked into very low rates and thus didn't sell 2. Housing supply overall remained low largely due to a lack of construction over the previous 10 years in response to the GFC. So, while rates did hurt demand, a lack of supply more than offset lower demand. Given that current homeowners were unwilling to sell, the only game in town became new home construction. Add millenials (a much larger generation than Gen X) entering peak home buying age, more people living alone or in small households, and a growing political trend away from strict zoning laws will keep fundamentals in new housing construction strong for the next 10-15 years.

The connection isn’t as straightforward as people believe because homebuilders use the excess margin to pay incentives to reduce the mortgage rate.

Home builders have been using incentives like “buydowns” where they pay to reduce the effective mortgage rate the buyer pays. Right now a 30 year fixed is 7.6% but with buydowns this can come down to 5% or so. This buydown comes straight out of homebuilder margins. So far the homebuilders have been able to pay these incentives and still deliver record gross margins. I’m not sure how sustainable that is.

Some other things to consider:

1) a bunch of new apartment supply is coming online right now across the nation. This could dent the demand for detached houses. If prices for single family houses go up further, more people may “give up” the idea of owning and just go to the nice apartment which just got cheaper. 

2) increasing concentration in housing suppliers. The homebuilders market position might shift a bit. Housing suppliers used to be a really fragmented industry. Housing suppliers (companies like Topbuild or Builders Firstsource, etc) have rolled up some smaller players and may be able to exert a bit more pressure on pricing. 

3) land prices. I’ve been seeing more and more homebuilders drawing down on the amount of owned/controlled land they have. Land prices, like everything else, have moved up a lot. Eventually homebuilders will have to come back out and grab some more land which will squeeze margins if they can’t raise price further. 

With several potential threats on margins, I’m not totally sure the builders can keep up the pace of incentives. So even if the Fed cuts rates, may not directly translate into positive environment for homebuilders."

1873,Cheap REIT?  Easterly Government Properties $DEA,2024-03-20 15:45:41,65.0,"This REIT caught my eye, it's trading near all-time lows (public since 2015) with a ~9.5% yield.    IMO it is unfairly getting beatdown as an office REIT, but its portfolio is unique.  $DEA owns VA Hospitals/clinics, fortified regional FBI/DEA headquarters complete with holding cells / forensic lab space, FDA lab space, courthouses, etc.  100% of the company's properties are leased, 95% of revenue comes from the US Gov, whose rental rates are linked to inflation.  Average remaining lease term is 10.5 years, all leases which expired in 2023 were renewed by the gov.

Only negative I can find is that their payout ratio is high, several analysts raised the issue on the last earnings call, but management is confident the current payout is sustainable given the visibility and security of future cashflows.   You can't expect the dividend to grow much near-term, this just looks like an attractive place to park some money if equity valuations look high.

When interest rates were low it was trading as high as 19x, now it's around 10x despite the same cash flows because of all office space being down and much higher cost of capital. Whether it deserved a premium of 19x because of the ultra stable government tenants is a question, but it will take a long time if ever to get back to that valuation. But at 10x right now and no rate hikes in the future, it's probably worth a look.

Office REITs specifically are not going to do well because REITs trade on real estate valuations and office values are potentially facing a very long bear market. Whether this is priced in with single digit valuations is possible, but I would take a speculative bet at best. The highest quality office REIT is ARE, its biotech offices are less affected by WFH, low debt, and located in AAA next to universities, but it's also priced that way at 14x. 

Besides office, other CRE are doing just fine because 1) Industrials have ultra low default rates due to targeted government stimulus, great US economy, and actually benefit from WFH, 2) Retail is having a renewal from post-pandemic travel 3) MF is just fine because rents have risen quite a lot. From what I can see, retail mall REITs are not trading very cheap and it's not known when post-covid boom will soften, so they aren't a buy here. Industrials are doing really well, they would have been decent buys the last time we had an inflation scare in Oct, but haven't had a major correction. They might be a buy just because industrials are doing so well. Non-mall retail like O and ADC are probably decent here, they're kind of cheap now. Medical REITs also aren't doing well because hospital costs have risen, they also have that ""specialization"" risk because there are not a lot of hospital buyers, but one I like is CHCT due to the low valuation and relatively low debt. MF REITs are also decent buys here, they haven't been this cheap in a while and I don't really see any issues with multifamily right now, something like MAA and CPT. Maybe there's some risk there with an apartment supply boom, but it seems to be priced in to me. I would avoid anything with super high yields like mortgage REITs, REITs with too much debt, and totally avoid externally managed REITs, they're terrible long term."

The books that come up regularly (Intelligent Investor, Margin of Safety if you can get a copy of it, Common Stocks, etc) are GREAT and every value investor should read them. Even if they can be somewhat dated, it's really useful to have the same ""educational background"" as other really successful investors.

What do the viable alternatives look like?

Right now a good course of action to perform a trade study against is the performance of a 5% money market fund. By keeping your money invested in your current position, you forego the 5% opportunity. That's a real cost.

If your current position will return 5%, the decision is a wash. (ignoring taxes)

But another trade study would be XYZ corp. I have a hot tip that XYZ Corp is going to do 30%. In that case, you really want to close your current position and buy XYZ.

I haven't really answered your question though. Other people hit on it. You need a solid rationale for comparing your current position to the viable alternative opportunities.

I'm a weak value investor. I do look at fundamentals and price. I have done liquidation value (Graham style) value analysis. I have not done a proper discounted cash flows (Buffet style) yet. That means I don't have a viable price target. I lack a quantitative rationale.

I have a qualitative exit point for my long term investments. When crude oil tankers start coming out of the ship yards near the end of 2027, that's when I start thinking about closing my position. The supply/demand consideration will turn against me. I also have to consider the ""peak oil"" idea.

Maybe you have a more qualitative rationale that you can use? E.g. you postulate the EVs are going to eat the market and decide to bet against gasoline producers.

Consider the current position in light of the viable alternatives. Consider opportunity cost."

1. Matt Harris discusses the critical future challenges facing banks, focusing on technological disruptions and the aftermath of financial instabilities.

2. He expresses a personal affection for banks but remains critical of their future in the face of technological innovation and changing financial landscapes.

3. He points out the significant impact of interest rate fluctuations, evidenced by the collapse of three major banks, indicating systemic vulnerabilities.

4. Harris highlights the growing problem of non-performing commercial real estate loans, exacerbated by persistently high interest rates, posing serious risks.

5. The inertia of consumers in financial decision-making is criticized, suggesting a shift in the sustainability of the traditional banking model due to changing interest rates and the introduction of real-time payment systems.

6. He anticipates a paradigm shift in banking, propelled by fintech innovation, challenging the traditional net interest margin model and questioning the future role of banks.

7. Harris suggests strategic responses for banks, including technology-driven product bundling and enhancing brand loyalty, to mitigate customer attrition and adapt to the competitive landscape.

8. He emphasizes the necessity for banks to engage in mergers and acquisitions to achieve scale and navigate the forthcoming ""messy phase,"" urging regulators to facilitate this transition."
1933,Creative Realities $CREX - Discover a cheap and hidden high margin recurring revenue business,2024-03-20 11:06:09,69.0,"Share price: $4.20   
Market cap: $44 million   
Revenue guidance 2024: $60-80 million  
Recurring revenue 2024: $18 million  
Backlog: $110 million  


Creative Realities $CREX is one of the largest digital signage companies in the US. Beneath the hardware part of their business lies the true gold - the high margin SaaS solution which comes with every screen the company installs. Below I summarise why I think this is a good investment opportunity which hasnt been reconized by the broader market.   
$CREX has a bit of messy history with multiple predecessors until the current CEO took lead of the company. Multiple acquisitions led to a complete platform of hardware (screens), software (SaaS) and services. The company got his current form in 2021 and has survived the difficult COVID years. This is the reason the chart looks kind of ugly longer term. Simply put, it was a different company back then.

in 2023 a private equity company tried to buy $CREX three times, their final offer was $2.85 and got declined by the management. In the following months that same PE company refused to renegotiate terms on a loan which caused management to do a small equity raise (CEO, CFO bought in as well). That raise will be sufficient until Q1/Q2 2024 when the company turns the free cashflow positive corner. The last few quarters they have been paying down debt quickly which leads to an improved balance sheet and more firepower in a highly fragmented market.

Tomorrow pre market $CREX releases FY2023 earnings and they will update 2024 guidance (narrow it down). Even at midpoint of their guidance it will mean a significant rise in revenue (+50%). They will print free cashflow in Q1 or Q2 2024 and will have a significant lower debt. Recurring revenue will be in focus, it probably will be covering all OPEX in 2024. All incremental $ will fall to bottom line. 

You can still buy into this growing business for less than 1x 2024 revenue and around 2 times 2024 ARR. I think there is a fair chance for the twin engine to ignite (multiple expansion and underlying growth).

This was just a quick note, there is much more to investigate and like when you dig a bit deeper (AI, Third party licensing of software, international rollout, new customers signed in 2024). I suggest watching a recent interview with the CEO on Planet Microcap.

Hi! I wanted to pick your brains on the subject of valuation methods for real estate companies/developers (keep in mind I am NOT talking about valuing a real estate property). I know there are quite a few methods available (like DCF, and NAV, among others) but what about valuing a company that has property over terrains/land that are not being developed. For example, if developer x has property over a 5-acre piece of land, how would you value the company? Would you make a forecast based on the prospect of that land later becoming a development? Or would you just take it as an asset/property without any special consideration?

This has been bugging me since this is not just any company, but a real estate developer, so what method should I use or what special (if any) considerations should I take in order to value the enterprise? Please let me know what you think!","['or', 'Real', 'am', 'mind', 'it', 'an', 'for', 'For', 'me', 'Hi', 'any', 'acre', 'has', 'on', 'Or', 'are', 'land', 'real', 'you', 'DCF', 'so']",,

While top-line revenue has grown steadily for years, the stock price hasn't kept pace. This is largely due to an Australian tax program that masks their true profitability. They've generated nearly 50% of their market cap in free cash flow (FCF) over the last few years, with FCF doubling over the past three years. This positions MSV.AX to reward shareholders handsomely.

Currently, Mitchell Services is laser-focused on returning capital to shareholders. They're delivering a substantial 12% dividend yield while exploring share buybacks. With a strong growth track record and a commitment to shareholder value, MSV.AX offers a compelling mix of income generation and significant upside potential as the market recognizes its true financial strength.

Sorry just trying to wrap my head around this as seems interesting- 

So overall, you are saying that due to this program, expenses are ""artificially"" higher (due to the write-off), which is resulting in a lower tax expense, but FCF is not affected due to non-cash nature of write-off expenses, which allows for higher FCF generation for the next two years? Does that translate to cash taxes paid as well?

Does this create a deferred tax asset balance that will need to be paid in the future? If yes, you are saying, who cares... they are returning cash back to investors for the next two years through a solid div and expected buybacks (saw BB plan is almost exhausted, but could be increased in future).

How much exposure do they have to Met Coal, and how is their services priced?

It’s not really causing “deferred” taxes because they were going to be able to avoid these taxes either way it just got front loaded. But yes this is causing much higher free cash flow for the next year and a half to 2 years but they’ll still have the ability to keep growing with instant write offs. 

If we assume they drop their D&A write off from $18m today to $2-$4m with everything else the same, this would impact FCF by about $4m/year due to tax expenses but by the time that impacts the company they’ll already be making $2m-$4m more in FCF due to the compounding effects of the business taxes saved. So this is why it’s such a great program for them. 

So if you want to calculate earnings you can probably just add $12m (USD) to earnings which would be a close-ish approximation which would be ~$20m, or $23m in normalized FCF. By the time the program dies off I think FCF will be sustainable around $27m-$30m assuming not much growth thereafter so a 8x multiple seems very conservative. Even if we say $25m in 2 years of FCF that’s at least a valuation of $200m (USD). Which is nearly 4x current EV."

1974,Terminology Question / Type of Gain,2024-03-20 23:18:14,73.0,"I need a little help with terminology so I can search out the correct... umm... terminology.

Say that I deposit $1,000 into an account. I trade $1,000 each day and make $100 for 30 consecutive days. The gain on each transaction is 10%.

At the end of the month I will have $3,000 in gains plus my initial $1,000 deposit for a balance of $4,000. The gain on the initial deposit is 300%.

It seems to me that investing pros would have some different terminology to distinguish the gain on the initial deposit from the gain on each transaction.

Companies just can’t stop talking about their plans to cut jobs.

And while all the layoff chatter is deeply unnerving for workers, executives keep talking about plans to slash payrolls for a pretty clear reason: Investors are eating it up.

It may seem counterintuitive for Wall Street to reward companies for letting people go. After all, layoffs are usually thought to be a sign that the business isn’t doing so hot. But plenty of these companies are [posting strong profits](https://www.businessinsider.com/layoffs-happening-at-tech-firms-that-are-doing-just-fine-2024-2) — they’re letting go of workers as part of an effort to show investors they’re serious about cutting costs and becoming more efficient.

2000,Interview with mutual fund manager,2024-03-20 09:02:01,77.0,"
Hi i am a long time lurker and high school senior. Recently, I cold-connected on LinkedIn with a mutual fund manager in the industrials and energy space (Scott Barbee) and he was surprisingly willing to have a conversation with me. I assume this is rare so please don’t inundate him with requests lol.

He is pretty well known in his niche given he has been in the top decile of performance over the last 3, 5, and 10 year timeline and has outperformed the S&P 500 and Russel 2000 since inception, with 11% net CAGR over last 25 years.

I am reading previous interviews he has had, but Given this opportunity, I want to come with some pretty solid questions lined up. Does anybody have any they would like to ask?

Here is what I have so far and intend to ask about one of his core positions that I actually did a research report on to win finalist in a stock pitch competition

- [ ] Undergrad education focus and importance in career?
- [ ] Opinion on specializing earlier in your career? Your background gives you a unique perspective with your dad working for Aramco and interning at Chevron then Simmons.
- [ ] Opportunity to start the aegis value fund post-MBA?
- [ ] You have one of the largest personal holdings I’ve seen for a mutual fund manager, do you think this gives way to a more balanced psychology when investing?
- [ ] What is the type of investor you like in your fund? Your deep value strategy naturally needs a contrarian perspective but how do you deal with fund investors being part of the consensus?
- [ ] Have you felt any fee compression pressure and what is your opinion on the future of the mutual fund structure versus that of the hedge fund?","['top', 'am', 'well', 'up', 'You', 'when', 'do', 'post', 'he', 'net', 'for', 'me', 'Hi', 'fund', 'any', 'has', 'cold', 'way', 'He', 'on', 'rare', 'you', 'so']",,

The fact that you are doing this in high school is immensely impressive, so don’t let my comment minimize what you are doing.

From my position as a Highschooler, the guy didn’t even has his email on the website so I had little hope LinkedIn would work.

I’ll definitely mention AI to him and his thoughts on the affects on his strategy (probably minimal as he does on site visits to management with unique contrarian view). 

Also do you think it is alright to attach my resume and my equity research on one of his top holdings I want to talk about.? Though I’m very happy to just speak to him, an internship this summer with his fund would be amazing."

Growing super rapidly while remaining prudent on lending standards. They have very low costs to acquire new customers (lots of word of mouth customer acquisition) and very high revenue per customer from mature cohorts. I really think it could be the first trillion dollar company in Latin America.

They went a little overboard on Star Wars content, and audience engagement started to dip. But I can’t fault Disney for that- it’s Star Wars after all. At the end of the day, having 1000+ characters to pull from is a massive win in my book. Regarding Disney, Buffet once said something like “The best part is that the Mouse doesn’t have an agent”. It’s the same for Captain America, Spiderman, all of the Marvel characters. It will take time to distill down the best use for each- but they’re all valuable resources.

Edit- And to bring it back to your main point, as long as Mickey isn’t making snuff films, I think Disney will be ok. People trip over themselves to get a chance to work at Disney (much like Apple). Thats the type of employee loyalty you really want with a family friendly company. 

I don’t know where things will be in the next 5 years. I think Iger needs to go, if nothing else to add some idea of stability for the next decade or so. But in 50 years, I have no doubt Disney will still be around, kids will love Mickey, and dads will be paying for DisneyWorld."

TSMC holds about 55% of the foundry market share so the US could delegate the ASML, AMAT, LAM technologies to companies like GloFo, Intel, Samsung, and even Apple if they wanted.

What I'm essentially saying is that the whole world would be greatly affected.  But the US companies would have (worse) alternatives rather than being completely controlled/affected like TSMC would.  I work as an engineer in this industry/field so I see a lot of what's happening in person.  It's also the reason why TSMC stock has been stagnant for 3+ years basically while US companies that are probably among the most reliant on TSMC (AMD, NVDA, etc) have blown up in the same 3 years."

With that said, I think that we're in broad agreement that if China invades Taiwan, that's going to be extremely bad news for TSMC shareholders.  And that it'd also be very bad news for Apple, and NVIDIA, and so on--it wouldn't be quite as bad, it's possible that the current investments that the government is making into chip fabs outside of that region would be able to fill some of the demand, and when production recovers, Apple and NVIDIA and so on will still be around and will still be at the top of their fields.

But the current stock pricing for those companies assumes that they're going to have more production in the next few years than they did in the last few years, and not that they're going to go back to the production levels of a decade ago.

The geopolitical risks for TSMC mean that in the case of a successful invasion by China, the company would be likely to lose. . . 80% of it's value?  90%?  Like you say, there's a lot of money that's being poured into the TSMC facility in Arizona, so it's not necessarily 100%, of TSMC that'd be gone, but the vast majority of the value in the company would be gutted.

What would the numbers on Apple look like, after that invasion?  A 30% drop?  40%?

At the moment--and for the last three years, or so--the market has been pricing that risk in to TSM, but it hasn't really been pricing that risk into AAPL.  Which doesn't mean that it's necessarily time to sell the one, or buy the other, but there's a discrepancy there, and it's one that's worth considering--if Apple is a buy, given the geopolitical risks, why not TSMC?  And if TSMC isn't a buy under the circumstances, why is Apple?"

It's purpose is to present the case that the U.S. stock market is overvalued due to the existence of a bubble. I'm posting this to the value investing forum because I do believe that value investing is superior to growth investing and speculating; I also think the bubbles' burst will result in value investors outperforming by a wide margin.

**What is a market-cap weighted index?**

It is a compilation of stocks like the S&P 500 which you can find more about [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) Basically, you invest money into a basket of stocks. A higher percentage of your investment goes to each company depending on its size. If you were to invest in the s&p  on March 19, 2024, about 7% of your dollar would purchase Microsoft, 6% would purchase apple and 5% would purchase Nvidia. These are the three largest components of the S&P 500 index. .01% of your dollar would go to smaller s&p 500 companies such as paramount and news corp.

**What is an equal-weight index?**

This is an index that holds all of the companies in an index at a fixed rate.  If you were to invest in an equal-weight index tracking the s&p  on March 19, 2024, .2% of your dollar would purchase Microsoft, .2% would purchase Nvidia, .2% would purchase paramount and newscorp as well. This type of index has flaws and is not a magic alternative to a market-cap weight index.

**The rise of passive investing**

Studies have shown that most active money managers underperform major market indices over time. This has led to huge inflows into instruments that track indices. It is claimed that between 80%-94% of all active managers under-perform the s&p depending on the [period of time.](https://www.ginsglobal.com/articles/94-of-us-fund-managers-underperform-sp-500-over-20-years/) Furthermore, it is claimed by Nassim Taleb in his book, *Fooled by Randomness*, that most active managers who out-perform indices do so because they are lucky. I have observed this when I hear them talk on bloomberg and cnbc and after I read their shareholder letters and youtube videos.

**Ok, so what's the problem**

The problem is that the s&p 500 index is a market weighted index and it is objectively expensive. It is currently trading around 38x free cash flow, 2.8x price to sales and 28x shiller p/e.

Yes, there is an equal weighted alternative to the s&p but its assets under management are insignificant. This market-weighted index of 500 companies now holds 80% of *all* U.S. market capitalization. Inflows have caused the index to be extremely top-heavy with the top 26 largest holdings quoting at 50% of the index's value. 50%! This is not due to the cash flows these companies are generating!!

**The top of the S&P is made up of extremely large overvalued companies**

Microsoft: 7% of the index trades at 46x fcf. It's price to FCF was 8 in 2009. Microsoft's growth prospects were just as good in 2009 as they are today yet the company is 6x the price

Apple: 6% of the index trades at 25x fcf. it's price to fcf was 11 in 2009 Apple's growth prospects are worse now than they were in 2009, with increasing competition in China and having successfully saturated developed market with iphones and other tech hardware.

Nvidia: 5% of the index trades at an extreme valuation with no basis in past results. Nvidia produced $3.8 billion in fcf in fy 23 yet its market capitalization is over $2 trillion

I'd guess that the market-weighting has resulted in roughly a $10 trillion bubble affecting the largest 40 or so s&p 500 companies. These companies are being bid-up by investor inflows into market weighted indices post-covid. Their earnings, sales, growth prospects, free cash flow ratios and growth do not support their current valuations. $10 trillion is one fifth of the U.S. stock market's valuation and it is built on nothing except inflows into market cap-weighted indices like the S&P 500. This bubble could help explain why the total us stock market is [expensive.](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/)

The extent of the bubble is determined by how overvalued you think s&p companies are, particularly the top-end of the market.

**Retail inflows since 2020**

There has been a speculative bonanza since covid. Retail investors have piled into stocks, with net inflows at about $2 trillion which is 5% of the total value of the U.S. equity market. [Just look at this insane chart.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-u-s-retail-investor-inflows-2014-2023/) Retail investors are speculating on stocks like microsoft, apple and nvidia and they are buying market-weighted indices like the S&P. In Berkshire's 2023 shareholder letter, warren buffet likened today's investors to gamblers and wrote that he did not anticipate this much speculative behavior in the market. The post-covid retail inflows help demonstrate why speculative behavior is increasing--a loss of faith in institutions have fostered a ""do it yourself"" mentality amongst novice investors.

**Tailwinds turning into headwinds**
Global growth has been helped by China for the last four or five decades. This looks like it’s going to end as Chinese growth slows under the weight of misguided central planning.

**What's going to happen**

Over 70% of retail investor aum is owned by people [58 and over.](https://www.broadridge.com/_assets/pdf/broadridge-insights-on-us-investor-data-study.pdf) If there's an event that sparks panic in the market, these people are going to get their smart phones out and all sell the same stuff because they own the same stuff. They are also all retired or are retiring soon. The result will likely look like the covid sell-off only on steroids, because valuations are much higher than they were four years ago.

With recent retail investor in-flows totaling $2 trillion, I'd expect to see at least that much leave at about the same time selling much of the same stuff.

**This issue is worldwide**

Global passive investing fund assets now exceed active investing aum. Almost all of those assets are in [market-weighted index funds](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-funds-passive-2024-02-01/). I would guess there is tens of trillions of dollars in market cap  allocated to the world's largest companies that is granted by way of market-weighted index fund inflows. The U.S. stock market is about  $50 trillion and the entire world equity markets are worth about $100-110 billion. A downturn in U.S. stocks will likely impact equity markets around the world.

I don't know about Amazon, and I think Google may be a little on the cheap side, but the other 5 of the Magnificent Seven are considerably overpriced. There's an AI bubble, everyone thinks that not only is this going to be huge, not only will these companies be the beneficiaries of that, but to some extent, they are not even reading why these companies have grown accurately.

Most of Microsoft's growth last year was about Microsoft Azure. Something like 30%. But only 1/5th of that growth (6%) was down to AI. The rest was just an increase in cloud hosting. Probably companies shifting from on-prem to cloud rather than increased demands.

There's more and more AI-related boards appearing, even based on RISC-V and a few people are starting to wake up to the fact that NVDA may not have this unassailable moat.

And all it will take is a couple of companies not getting huge growth and the late entry investors will panic and run from this stuff, and they'll be a run.

Also of note: as these companies have pushed up SPY this has led to more money going into SPY which boosts all other stocks in the index. If people start dumping SPY it won't just affect the Mag 7."

The difference between then and now comes from the valuations and the amount of retail inflows into the indices. valuations were much more attractive 10 years ago. Retail inflows have ramped up the past four years. This bubble looks about 4 years in the making, not ten years.

I do disagree with this because the data show that almost all passive investors have significantly outperformed almost all active investors over a long enough time period. The issue I'm pointing out is different although it does result from passive investing.

I am a newbie investor located in EU and i am currently holding and buying a combination of IWDA + EMIM ETFs for Developed and Emerging makert exposure..  
The allocation i currently hold is something like 60% IWDA + 40% EMIM  
I strongly believe that emerging markets will rise in the future and i am willing to bet on it..  
There are some countries , like Indonesia , Mexico , Brazil , Nigeria that i would like to have a bit more exposure than EMIM give me..  
Indonesia for example has currently less than 2% representation in EMIM which makes it less than 1% of my total portfolio.  


How can i achieve a bit bigger exposure on some countries of interest?

  
Does it make sense to buy some ETFs that focus on those countries as an addition to my portfolio or the rebalancing from the ETF itself will be sufficient to cover those markets in the future if they start to have a bigger share?  
Or maybe holding some individual stocks from each of those countries is a better option?  
Which option will give me more returns in case the markets in those specific countries rise?

I guess in terms of risk it goes like Individual Stocks > Country Based ETF > EMIM ETF

What other kind of exposure to those countries of interest will be good options besides the stock market?

PE is a fine measure of a stock as a quick & dirty heuristic for cheap/expensive.  Its biggest limitation is that the earnings in question (let’s say we are using TTM PE) may not be representative of the earnings in the future.  If they are not, the information value is very low.  If the earnings of the company are very steady, suppose approaching the reliability of a government bond, the ratio is quite useful.

I usually try to estimate a “normalized” earnings level for the company if I am interested in it.  In many (most) cases, I am not able to sensibly do that, so I just put the company in the “too hard” pile and move on.  But when I can, the metric is useful."

For example, even in 1996 early dotcom, 30Y was around 7%. Meaning you could lock in what would be considered today obscenely generous yields with far less of an uncertain inflation outlook (at least IMHO). So obviously, valuations today are not even remotely comparable

This is a really solid point, but it's not clear what to actually do about it. If you were to consider multiples in the context of interest rates, you would probably conclude the US market is overvalued as a whole and not invest in it, or only very little. Actually, maybe this is a fair conclusion. But for an equity investor is going to put money into stocks and just wants to know which ones, rather than whether to do it at all, not very useful.

Also interest rates change... if they came down in future, then it would make no sense to avoid stocks today, in fact that would probably cause you to buy at a higher price later (depending why rates come down)

> Since 2019 when the ample reserves / floor system became the official policy stance of the Fed, the chance of an event like Covid creating lost decades became dramatically less. Meaning the chance stocks get semi-permanently crushed also diminished.

> And PE comparisons do not reflect this significant reduction in risk

Mmm, this is a potentially dangerous line of thought IMO. Stocks can suffer regardless of what the central bank does. See how long it took Japan's market to recover from the 1989 crash in spite of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Stocks are risky and always will be.

The rate might be historically low, but by the same token, multiples are historically high.

3. AT&T stuck Paramount in the spin off with an enormous debt burden that they cannot repay without eating their seed corn, which is why every quarter Paramount+ subscribers drop. The balance sheet is over leveraged with liquidity challenges due to the national box office decline.  (Some facts relate to WBD, and some to NAI, but none to Paramount).

In sum, stock price go down!

Reality:

1. Through vMVPDs and MVPDs, more people subscribe to linear TV than ten years ago, which is significant. Carriage fees are an important part of the business. Ad revenues in the first quarter of 2024 were up substantially, negating claims that linear TV is dead.


2. Paramount+ is the fastest growing streamer since launch, taking market share, while Pluto TV is a leader in FAST. Paramount is a major arms dealer to streaming rivals.


3. Paramount has a traditionally conservative debt-equity corporate finance structure. Paramount is paying off debt further to remain a strong credit. Paramount has repaid billions in recent years while building DTC from negligible to a major player. Paramount is operating profitably and with positive cash flow.

2307,CEIX - stock pitch (to myself),2024-03-19 12:17:13,89.0,"Hi all,

Before I buy or sell any stock, I do a one page summary to myself. Here's my pitch to myself so I can re-review later and remember what I was thinking. I hope it helps others.

Feel free to review and point out why I might be wrong....:-)

Current price (18-3-24): $81    
CEIX are a US low-cost producer of bituminous coal. Most of its revenue comes from thermal coal, however it sells around 10% of metallurgical coal for steel making and industrial applications. Metallurgical coal comes from the company’s Itmann mine. The company has been going for over 100 years,  but CEIX formed in 2017 when the gas and coal operations separated. it uses a well established long wall mining technique. Over 71% of its coal is exported using CEIX own shipping terminal (CONSOL Marine Terminal which is also well connected to 2 different rail routes). Exports and metallurgical coal are growth areas for the business as US scales back on fossil fuels. Here’s why I think CEIX is a buy:  
\-	The current P/E is 3.66 and P/S is 0.94  
\-	Return on Capital Employed is 35%  
\-	Free Cash Flow payout is 18%  
\-	Operating margin is 30% (net 25%)  
\-	Current ratio of 1.35   
\-	Debt is decreasing  ($2.5bn in 2017 to $1.3bn in 2023) whilst assets have remained constant.  
\-	It’s one of the most efficient operators in the market, with the PAMC mine in Pennsylvania managing 7.6 tons extracted per employee compared to a US average of 3.6  
\-	It’s average revenue per ton of coal is $76 whilst the average cost is $36 per ton.  
\-	Whilst coal usage in the developed is being phased out, coal still accounts for around 30% of global energy demand, with India and China being the main consumers. It will take decades to phase coal out as an energy source. Coal has some distinct advantages over renewables – it’s in abundant supply, it’s easy to mine, transport, store and provides a guaranteed energy source (as opposed to wind and solar). It doesn’t require special equipment such as LNG does with cooling and pressurised containers.  
Taking a DCF view, using CEIX’s average metrics over the last 5 years produces the following:  
FCF growth	P/E ratio	Discount rate%	Future share price $	Comment  
5%	4	10	105	FCF growth has averaged 20% over the past 5 years  
10%	4	10	132	  
20%	4	10	204	  
  
Another way to think of it is what’s the coal worth if you could sell it (below uses a simple model) with pricing per ton over the next 10 years (assuming that’s when demand optimistically vanishes).  
 	Coal price over 10 yrs $	Extraction cost next 10 years	Tons extracted	Value next 10 years  
High	100	70	35,000,000	10,500,000,000  
Med	80	60	26,000,000	5,200,000,000  
Low	70	50	15,000,000	3,000,000,000  
  
I see a potential upside of 50% over the next 5 years. The main risks being a transition away from coal at an accelerated and unexpected pace leading to significant falls in the global coal price.

Their guidance I think was sub 100 per ton and it’s over that.  They own the terminal and can pivot and export to whatever country will pay more. Natural gas prices are at the bottom right now and will probably go up. They pledged massive by backs. I think good things are in the future. 50 percent upside in 5 years is too low. This is a 2-5x depending on the price of coal and a market retailing of P/E ratio when they realize they still are going to need coal for a long time. Oh and they are mining more coaling coal now which isn’t going away for 60 years. You need it to make steel, all these high rises and electric vehicles etc."

The general expectation is that seaborne coal will decline, but by how much depends on which research report you read (IEA have 16% by 2026), whereas S&P global market intelligence and IHS Markit report a flat\\slow decline up to 2030.

Finding the information on contracts and prices is proving tricky, in 2022 35% of revenues came from contractual agreements. Typically they sign multi year contracts.

2328,Are large caps outperforming because small caps are losing money?,2024-03-19 02:41:29,91.0,"I've gone through largely all the US-based public companies under a 2B market cap (roughly 2,000), and if I had to summarize the experience, I'd call it disappointing. Just to clarify, when I say ""gone through"", I mean I've tried to replicate the Value Line experience by quickly looking over the business description and financial history of the company through my favourite stock screener. Once in a while, something will leap off the page and I'll give the company a deeper look.

Pretty much everywhere you look in the small cap world, things kinda suck. Companies are losing money, dilution is very common, the brands that you come across are almost entirely unknown (to me at least) and yet (I have no data at hand to back this up) for many of these mediocre businesses the multiples are still holding up. I have seen disappointing growth curve after disappointing growth curve (a sharp drop in a longer-term growth trend in revenues or profits) and in many cases valuations remain optimistic. But in terms of obvious bargains? I've found zero that I could put half my net worth in tomorrow and be able to sleep that night.

Checking the returns of the S&P indices shows a similar story:

* S&P 500: **12.69%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P MidCap 400: **8.86%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P SmallCap: **6.07%** 5 YR AVG. RETURN

Will this large-cap outperformance go on forever? Over the last 10 years, the spread gets a bit tighter:

* S&P 500: **10.65%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P MidCap 400: **7.72%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN
* S&P SmallCap: **6.50%** 10 YR AVG. RETURN

Yet how come large and mid caps have done better in the last 5 years than in the last 10 years, and the opposite is true for the small caps?

The Mag 7 were weighted to make up 23% of the S&P 500 and around 47% in the Nasdaq. 

I'd be curious how the middle 20% of the 500 are doing with that much concentration. 

Aside from that, 500 are also analyzed forwards, backwards, and sideways.  They're far more likely to be priced efficiently at fair value more often than not, or potentially overvalued, because of all of the attention they get.  Of course not 100% of the time, but often enough.  As an amateur, I get enough of them by indexing in my retirement accounts. 

The 5000' view is simple.  Index weighting grossly favors those mega-cap stocks.  Most of which are further concentrated into Tech.  Which are, simply put, having an awesome run.   

Small caps, I believe offer a far greater opportunity of being underpriced, frequently offering a good potential on margin of safety.  Does it carry more risk?  Define risk for me first, then I can give an opinion.  

Looking at underperformance relative to the S&P over the past few years, no argument.  Small Cap has underperformed.  The instabilities of the pandemic, supply chain snarls, and inflation have been... interesting.  Okay, difficult to weigh in the short term.  However, we're not in it for the short view.

But with that disclaimer I’ll give you my take:

• Yes, I am happy with my returns so far. Despite a few really dumb mistakes I’ve managed to generate some alpha over the past few years and have hopefully set myself up for outsized returns in the future by buying low in the bear market. Loads of people on reddit will say it’s impossible to beat indices over long periods of time. This simply isn’t true. Investing has also been a way for me to learn a ton about the economy, the world at large, specific industries, human nature, etc. etc. Overall a very rewarding experience.

• It’s not realistic to get 15% returns every year. Annualized, maybe, but there will be drawdowns that bring great stock picks down with them. And you may have to watch bad stock picks outperform you in the short term! Even Buffett and Munger had bad years, and it wasn’t because they bought bad businesses. 

• My experience so far suggests becoming a great investor is a lifelong endeavor. But just in terms of getting going, after a couple years I feel I’m finally starting to find my niche in micro and small caps.

• Definitely learn the basic valuation methods and price ratios before buying. But truth be told, these are not as simple as they seem at first glance because of accounting practices and industry-specific quirks. At some point you have to just dive in and make the mistakes. Start with a small amount of money and learn as you go.

Best of luck to you!"

You won't beat the market. Very few do, and those have vastly superior resources (technology, manpower, insider information perhaps...).

2. 15% is a high ROI. You can certainly get it some years, but in a bear market you won't get it.

3. As far as strategy, the number one key is to buy low and sell high. The market is primarily driven by fear and greed, and it will be up to you to decide which is active at the time of purchase. Then, every strategy focuses on trying to find when to buy and when to sell. A stock's fundamental value may or may not be accurately reflected in the price.

4. My advice, put the majority of your holdings in an S&P500 index fund. Yes I understand that it isn't as fun, but your gains will be more consistent, aka better, over the long haul.

2403,Apple Paying Almost $500M Over the Tim Cook's China Comments,2024-03-18 14:56:09,95.0,"So, if you checked news back in 2018, that comments was before the first Apple's revenue cut and loss more than $70B with the stock fall.  
  
During the call in the same 2018, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.  
  
And just in two months Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.  
  
This was the reason of several big scandals and lawsuits based on the Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).  
  
So, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because yesterday, news reported that Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing), so if you were one of those damaged investors, you can [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).
