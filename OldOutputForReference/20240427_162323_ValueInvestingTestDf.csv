I beleive its very underrated metric.  **Retained earnings** represent the cumulative total of earnings that a company has yet to pay to shareholders and is found on the Balance Sheet.  While the number itself is less important - what is important to me is the overall trajectory of retained earnings - i.e its growth and growth rate.  I want to see the retained earning growing from year to year hopefully at a rapid pace.  Typically I look at least 5 years of retained earnings.  It can tell us a lot about the compounding ability of a stock.

56,Question on AkerCarbonCapture JointVenture,2024-04-27 15:34:16,4.0,"I have been trying to wrap my head around this for two days. AkerCarbonCapture (ACC.OL) has 4.25NOK market cap currently. They recently announced entering a joint venture with SLB. The deal is SLB pays them 4.1B in cash and they keep around 0.4B of company cash. In return, they move their operations to a new entity where Aker keeps 20% ownership and SLB 80%. SLB also adds their carbon business to the JV for 0.5B NOK which is around the remaining cash Aker has now.

Have been trying to wrap my head around what this means for investors in Aker. Do they hold a share of this cash in exchange for a 5x dilution in the new joint venture company? Or is it something else?

2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google’s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn’t too far back. 

The space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.

Generative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. 

**Google’s Trailing Cloud Services** 

This new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google’s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google’s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. 

**Gemini Comeback**

Google’s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.  
  
However, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.  
  
**Microsoft's Domination**

The narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI.   
  
The bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft’s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft’s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI’s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another.   
  
The company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.

More sticky baseline revenue (while in serious competition), more corporate revenue, duopoly in a gaming segment they’re turning into a publisher monopoly, military work, hardware dev (r+d & released products).

Google meanwhile have ads and data scraping from :-
[they’re dominant, with little competition. That’s changing in small increments, and they’ve basically reached saturation in those realms bordering on defeating the function of their products. Like YouTube ads as they currently are.]

Their R&D and productization stream is piss poor, always giving up when they hit the ‘needs post launch support’ level, like Google Home / the game streaming thing, social media and endless other things.

The only major factor is that Microsoft are priced like they’re going to perpetually perform, meaning a few failures could knock them down.  HOWEVER, Google are still 30:1 PE with little growth opportunities, beyond cramming in more ads into existing mature products. Between the two, Google is overvalued unless they change how they do business.

Personally, META looks better priced (PE wise) than Google, plenty of opportunity and zero growing competition, except maybe MSFT buying TikTok US arm…."

I'm not saying these companies will all take over Google completely, but what is the chance Google keeps their 90% market share? Close to zero imo. Whether it drops to 20% or 70% is what I dont know. 

I dont believe what no one is going to use Meta Search instead of Google going forward. You're in the app already and see something you wanna buy. Instead of going out of IG, FB or WA you just search it directly in app. 

It used to be impossible to get into the search business for many search because it was a winner takes it all business. That has changed, especially with LLMs added to the search."

E.g. under IFRS 9 rules it can be in 3 risk weighting stages, stage 1 is fine, stage 2 you need to recognise a %  as impairments but can still recognise interest payments, stage 3 large % is impaired and interest it put into ECL (expected credit losses). So basically if the borrower is prime and repays fully its quite simple, but subprime gets complicated as you recognise losses upfront, but they will be later adjusted depending upon what actually happens. IMO its why credit as a % of GDP is far less to sub prime since 08 as banks simply aren't as profitable. Whereas mortgages still very safe and lucrative, but competitive."

98,Warren Buffett Built Berkshire. What Happens When He’s No Longer There? - Barron's on MSN,2024-04-26 13:29:25,8.0,"  
[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/warren-buffett-built-berkshire-what-happens-when-he-s-no-longer-there/ar-AA1nGYvR)   
  
Story by Andrew Bary  
  
Warren Buffett will be at center stage, as usual, during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting. But investors are increasingly looking for clues on what the company will be like when the longstanding CEO and chairman is no longer running it.  
  
Berkshire could come under pressure to break itself up when the world’s most acclaimed investor exits the stage. It might decide to pay a dividend rather than amass cash, as it does today while Buffett, 93, waits for investing opportunities. Buffett can expect to face questions on all these topics and more at the annual meeting on May 4 in Omaha, Neb.  
  
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s longtime friend, business partner, and Berkshire vice chairman, who died last year at 99, won’t be at his side. Munger’s absence will only reinforce the obvious: Buffett’s time atop the conglomerate he built over six decades could end during the next few years. Even Buffett acknowledges as much, writing in November that he felt “good” but was “playing in extra innings.”  


For some 30,000 Berkshire shareholders expected to attend the meeting, the future will be the focus as Buffett fields questions for more than five hours in what could be his only public appearance of the year. Joining Buffett on the dais will be Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, likely tasked with the role of Buffett’s successor as CEO, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, who runs the company’s insurance operations. Together they will answer questions small and large: Can the stock beat the S&P 500 index? Why have share repurchases declined since 2021? Can the company’s new management prove anywhere as capable as Buffett? Should Berkshire break up?  
  
But really, everyone will be focused on the same thing.  
  
“Whether it’s said out loud or not, succession is front and center on the minds of investors,” says Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst.  
  
There is nothing like Berkshire. It has had an extraordinary run since Buffett took control of a struggling textile maker in 1965 and turned it into the world’s largest conglomerate, with nearly 400,000 employees and U.S.-centric businesses that offer one of the best reads on the health of the economy. Some of its largest divisions are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad; Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which operates a multistate electric utility business that is one of the largest producers of green power in the country; and the world’s biggest property and casualty insurer, including Geico, the No. 3 auto insurer.  
  
There are smaller units, such as NetJets, the leader in private jet travel; Clayton Homes, the top maker of manufactured housing; Benjamin Moore paints; Dairy Queen; and one of the largest real estate brokerage businesses in the country. Then there is a $360 billion equity portfolio led by Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Berkshire’s holdings. There also is what Buffett calls a Fort Knox balance sheet, with nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents.  
  
Berkshire isn’t run like other conglomerates. It is unusually decentralized, with Buffett leaving key decisions at subsidiaries largely to the managers of the individual companies. He wrote in the Berkshire “Owner’s Manual” in 2017 that “we delegate almost to the point of abdication.” Berkshire has a tiny headquarters staff of 26 with no corporate counsel, investor relations, or public relations staff.  
  
Berkshire’s unusual strategy has worked. The company is expected to generate $40 billion of after-tax operating earnings this year and has a market capitalization of $880 billion, the seventh-largest in the stock market. The company’s Class A stock has risen to over $600,000 a share from $20 (there have been no stock splits along the way) since Buffett took over in 1965, and holders who bought the now widely held Class B shares when they were created in 1996 have seen that stock rise 20-fold. It’s one of the most widely held stocks by individuals, with some three million shareholders. Probably no other company elicits the passion and loyalty of its investor base. Big institutions have never appreciated the stock as much as individuals.  
  
But will they continue to, once Buffett is no longer running the show? So central is Buffett to Berkshire’s business that four or five people will take over the role that he maintained until 2018, when he delegated responsibility for Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses to Abel and the insurance operations to Jain.  
  
Abel is due to become CEO, which involves overseeing Berkshire’s vast array of businesses and likely determining capital allocation, a critical role at the company that Buffett has performed so well for nearly 60 years. That means deciding whether to use earnings to repurchase stock, pay dividends, build cash, or make acquisitions. Jain is likely to remain head of the insurance business, while Buffett’s older son, Howard, 69, a farmer and philanthropist, probably will become nonexecutive chairman.  
  
Then there are Todd Combs, 53, and Ted Weschler, 61, who now run about 10% of Berkshire’s equity investments and probably will run the entire portfolio. Berkshire doesn’t say which stocks in the equity portfolio are run by Combs and Weschler, but Berkshire watchers think that many of the smaller holdings—under $4 billion—are theirs. These include Charter Communications, DaVita, Liberty Sirius XM, Amazon.com, Snowflake, Visa, and Mastercard. Buffett hasn’t commented on their performance relative to the market since 2019—when he said they were slightly behind it since joining the company more than a decade ago. We estimate that both are probably lagging behind the market since their tenures began, given the underperformance of some of their rumored holdings in recent years.  
  
Investment manager Bill Smead, who heads the Smead Value fund, would like to hear from Combs and Weschler. “Not introducing Todd and Ted is an unforgivable sin. If Warren dies tomorrow, they are the stockpickers, and they have never answered or been asked a question at the annual meeting.”  
  
Combs is a key member of the Berkshire bench and could be a backup to Abel as the Buffett successor or a potential successor to Abel as CEO. Combs has a good rapport with Buffett and has experience beyond investments as CEO of Geico for past four years and as a JPMorgan Chase board member. One candidate to succeed Jain as head of the insurance operations is Joe Brandon, who runs Alleghany, an insurer that Berkshire bought in 2022.  
  
Buffett’s three children, Howard, Susan, and Peter, will be in the mix after Buffett’s death since they will oversee a charitable trust that will hold Buffett’s now 15% economic stake in Berkshire, which has voting power of over 30% because it consists almost entirely of supervoting A shares. The Buffett stake will allow the children to wield considerable power, at least for several years, as the trust will liquidate over about a decade.  
  
While Buffett acknowledges that he has slowed down in recent years, he looked sharp at the 2023 meeting. He talked for five hours, fortified with a Coke and peanut brittle from See’s Candies, a Berkshire company. He showed command of all things Berkshire, the economy, and financial markets, both past and present. He is the last of a breed. Three years ago, there were four Berkshire directors age 90 or over—all longtime friends of Buffett—and they all are dead: Munger, David “Sandy” Gottesman, Tom Murphy, and Walter Scott. Smead says that without the outspoken Munger to prod him, Buffett may be more restrained at this year’s meeting.  
  
That won’t stop investors from peppering him with questions. How long do you expect to run the company? What do Berkshire’s slowing stock repurchases say about your views on the stock? Can Geico, which has slipped behind Progressive in auto insurance market share and technology, catch up? Would Berkshire walk away from its Western utilities and let them go bankrupt in the face of wildfire liabilities? Do you think it will make sense to pay a dividend once you’re gone?  
  
Buffett says he expects tough questions. “That’s the way we like it,” he wrote earlier this year.  
  
“There will be more discussion of the possibility of a dividend at some point in time,” says Ted Bridges, CEO of Bridges Trust, an Omaha investment manager. Buffett has conceded that buying public and private businesses is tough now, given higher valuations. And Berkshire handicaps itself by refusing to participate in corporate auctions. The dividend issue arouses passion among many individual Berkshire holders who don’t want them, in part for tax reasons.  
  
An important question, asked or not, is what will happen to Berkshire shares when Buffett steps down or dies. They may take a hit of perhaps 5% to 10%, as longtime holders cash out and investors worry that the Buffett magic will disappear. Buffett, though, has said he thinks the stock will go up on the day after his death as investors anticipate a value-enhancing corporate breakup.  
  
There’s a case to be made for a breakup. It’s the world’s biggest conglomerate at a time when conglomerates have fallen out of favor, with the likes of General Electric and United Technologies having broken up in recent years. For all of Buffett’s investment acumen and business smarts, Berkshire stock is about even with the S&P 500 as measured by total return over the past 10 years and 20 years, Bloomberg calculations show. The stock has returned 12.4% annually over the past 10 years, against 12.5% for the S&P 500. Buffett has said that Berkshire needs to top it over time or investors should consider looking elsewhere.  
  
All the massive outperformance came in Buffett’s first 40 years at the helm, when the company was smaller and Buffett had a particularly hot investment hand, scooping up big stakes in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express at cheap prices. Size, too, is an impediment to outsize returns.  
  
Buffett hasn’t had a lot of new winners in the past decade. The company’s largest acquisition—the 2016 purchase of Precision Castparts for $33 billion—has been a bust. Buffett has had some misses in the stock market, selling a group of financial stocks including Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in 2020 and 2021 at about half their current prices. Of course, Apple has been a huge win with Berkshire’s stake, now worth over $150 billion, compared with a cost of around $30 billion. But the iPhone giant is having a rough 2024, and its stock is down more than10% year to date.  
  
Berkshire shares look like a good bet to match or beat the S&P 500 even after Buffett leaves the scene. The stock now looks appealing, valued at 1.5 times its projected March 31 book value of nearly $400,000 per Class A share and for 22 times estimated 2024 earnings. (Berkshire is due to report its first-quarter results on May 4.) Berkshire is slightly expensive relative to its five-year average of 1.4 times book value. The stock is ahead of the market this year and over the past five years.  
  
Book value is an old-fashioned valuation measure but is still relevant for Berkshire because of its large insurance operations—insurers still get valued on book—and because it has been a historical yardstick for the company since Buffett took over.  
  
Buffett chooses to focus on intrinsic value but doesn’t disclose his estimate of that figure. Buffett has said that book value is a greatly understated proxy for intrinsic value, although share repurchases at current prices do reduce book value, somewhat undercutting the use of that measurement.  
  
Post Buffett, Berkshire’s stock is likely to be supported by steady growth in its earnings and shareholder equity over time. The company appears capable of high-single-digit annual growth in book value based on $40 billion of operating income after taxes and gains in the $360 billion equity portfolio. If the stock keeps pace with the growth in book value, it could show similar share price growth.  
  
A dividend is a good bet within a few years of Buffett’s death. Why? It will help his successor disburse some of the annual operating earnings. Another reason is that investors won’t be so tolerant of Berkshire holding so much cash—a record $168 billion at year-end 2023—without Buffett at the helm.  
  
Christopher Bloomstran, chief investment strategist at Semper Augustus Investment Group, wrote earlier this year that Berkshire stock could generate a 10% to 11% annualized return over the next 10 years, with annual share buybacks in the 2% to 3% range—above the recent rate of 1% to 1.5%. He pegged intrinsic value at around $720,000 a share.  
  
UBS analyst Brian Meredith is one of the few Berkshire bulls among Wall Street analysts. He recently lifted his price target to about $722,000 per Class A share from $715,000. He sees improvement at both Geico and Burlington Northern. Berkshire is one of the most defensive big stocks in the market, given its balance sheet and earnings power. A market selloff could offer opportunities for Buffett.  
  
Buffett is firmly against a breakup. He argues the conglomerate structure has numerous attributes, including tax benefits from the ability to quickly make use of any big catastrophe losses at Berkshire’s insurance companies. Buffett has expressed confidence in the company’s future, writing last year that “Berkshire has been built to last.” And the company’s Buffett-friendly 14-member board—including two of Buffett’s kids—is well aware of his views.  
  
“Berkshire has been run with enormous transparency, integrity, a long-term orientation, and a culture of stewardship. It is run by the greatest investor in history. That’s the present,” Chris Davis, an investment manager and Berkshire board member, told Barron’s last year. “As for the future, every activist and investment banker will argue that in a world without Warren and Charlie, Berkshire’s unorthodox structure shouldn’t persist. I think it’s worth defending.”  
  
Whatever the questions, Berkshire shareholders will savor the annual meeting, knowing there may not be many more with Buffett at the helm. As for the stock, many may heed the advice of Munger, who said that “they should keep the faith” rather than sell after he and Buffett are gone.","['run', 'base', 'Fe', 'cash', 'four', 'Can', 'you', 'ar', 'he', 'beat', 'pay', 'cost', 'Big', 'He', 'both', 'key', 'Coke', 'It', 'son', 'lot', 'msn', 'For', 'has', 'do', 'it', 'now', 'so', 'When', 'can', 'kids', 'out', 'Bill', 'six', 'MSN', 'hear', 'big', 'an', 'top', 'are', 'up', 'rise', 'next', 'well', 'age', 'be', 'hand', 'All', 'two', 'say', 'for', 'go', 'www', 'So', 'fund', 'fold', 'on', 'or', 'Post', 'huge', 'five', 'real', 'See', 'An', 'way', 'any', 'good', 'Do', 'all', 'best', 'when', 'Joe', 'ago', 'by', 'UBS']",,

When Warren Buffet passes if the stock dips it is absolutely a buying opportunity.  I think current p/e is 10 and stock is very diversified in holdings.  Essentially even if they just return cash as dividend your downside is very low but solid upside.  Last food for thought but Buffet is 94 and others contribute a lot to the business who basically are there forever.  So business should be solid without him.  Genuine hope Warren stays in good health and keeps tap dancing to work.

I am going into my summer of Junior year in college and will be working at an investment bank making good money.  Basically, all this money I have I am not going to need for a long time and would like to invest it. 

I have followed the markets extremely close and invested in stocks since freshman year of high school (first stock I bought was Tesla). Unfortunately, on my 20th birthday I had my identity stolen and my Robinhood with $35,000 liquidated. I didn't lose the money but haven't re invested it. 

When I think of what to do I want safety and I think the market as a whole qqq spy type deal is too expensive and lacking near term growth (in my view but probably wrong). I like gold but don't want to put all my money in a non growing asset. I like crypto but also think that would be dumb to put more money into crypto. I am thinking about buying a condo to rent out, but I have not decided yet.

This is a breakdown of my capital and curious to hear others input. As someone financially literate, it is mind numbing and extremely dumb that I am not even in like treasury bills but I am ready to make a change.

Im not a crypto guy so you probably don't want to hear my thoughts on that.

Normally, that kind of concentration doesn’t make sense but your portfolio is growing fast given your savings rate. E-L Financial ELF.TO or ELFIF, for 45% makes sense.

Portfolio diversification
Many investors turn to commodities for diversification as commodity returns will typically move in the opposite direction of stocks and bonds due to the low or negative correlation between the three asset types.

Inflation protection
Investors also use commodities to potentially provide a level of protection against inflation due to the positive correlation commodities have with inflation, generally appreciating when inflation rises."""

208,Payday 3 owner Starbreeze is paying you $4m to buy the company,2024-04-25 17:38:17,15.0,"Weird situation here, starbreeze has a market-cap of $26m.

It's cash on hand is $30m giving it an EV of $-4m.

This is because investors believe management will keep killing the company (i.e the terrible payday3 launch) and losing free cash flow making the company worthless.

If you look at their cash flow from operations they are actually generating a positive amount.

The issue is their Capex (i.e investing in games) has been trash, throwing money down the drain such as focusing on small random games instead of focusing on their main IP properly which is payday.

Now usually in these situations it all depends on management, if management is shit they will continue to kill the company and the company is worthless (like it was with the old CEO). However the useless CEO has been kicked out which makes this a potential recovery play IF a new good CEO is found that does the following:

- Stops wasting capex on poor ROIC projects like small games and other stuff

- Focuses their investment on fixing Payday3 and making it actually something decent.

- Immediately cancels the Dungeons and Dragons shit IP they have bought (really they should focus on multiplayer shooting games only...)

- Shuts down the third party publishing business

- Fires 50% of the team

This is kind of similar to Meta in 2022, investors were pricing in zuckerberg just continuing to act like a robot and throwing money down the train at VR.

If a good CEO is found it's possible this could change.

What the new CEO needs to do it fire a bunch of people as soon as they join and streamline the company.

The issue is they have an interim CEO who was an old board member and looks useless as well to me.

The question is, how much is the Payday brand still worth after they fucked up Payday3 SO badly?

Payday3 only has 200 concurrent players now, whereas Payday2 has 17k. Even though it's an old title it still retains huge numbers and will still generate profit with more DLC.

Thoughts? I think this all depends on the new CEO but this looks like one of the situations where it probably can't get any worse given they have no debt, new potential management and cash on hand IF they get a good perm CEO

I think this is worth putting on a watchlist and waiting if a new CEO comes in that isn't an idiot.

This was a strong quarter. The team is balancing hefty CapEx with strong income statement profit growth; the added context surrounding efficiency gains offsetting depreciation increases is important. The positive commentary on advertising demand bodes well for this company, and basically every other company left to report in the programmatic advertising space. It continues to turn Google Cloud into another quickly growing business with ample operating leverage. It continues to rapidly iterate in GenAI search. And? It continues to be one of the most iconic performers of the 21st century. Congratulations to shareholders on more profitable compounding.

f. Microsoft's Take

Like Google, Microsoft is second to none in terms of consistent execution and drama-less profitable compounding. And like Google and Meta, CapEx will continue to soar to support GenAI infrastructure. Still, margin preservation is strong, shareholder returns are growing and this company just keeps executing… quarter after quarter. Another great report. Enough said."

260,Which would you choose ? Fastenal vs Simpson Manufacturing (link to data sheet),2024-04-26 04:13:22,21.0,"Hi,

I am sharing my data for two companies in the fastener business, fasteners are the screws, nuts and bolts used in the building industry. 

Both are, in my opinion, very high quality companies despite being cyclical.

High quality being the consistency of earnings and revenue, as well as the four ""rokkers"" being above the industry average (ROA, ROE, ROIC and ROCE). 

One is Fastenal $FAST a 39bn distributor of fasteners, the other is the manufacturer of fasteners, Simpson Manufacturing $SSD, which despite being older is much smaller than Fastenal. 

These are both boring companies that experienced missed earnings recently. One reason could be the reduced housing starts this year compare to past years.

Here is a google sheet with the date of both companies:

Simpson has similar metrics, margins, ROE etc even though it’s business is 3 times smaller than Fastenal and is growing twice as fast per year for the last 5 years and double the earnings growth rate every year for the last 10 years.

However Fastenal commands a premium over Simpson, maybe it is because of its dividend policy. Fastenal is paying out the bulk of its free cash flow as dividends, the dividend ratio is approaching 70% and it has been growing its dividend at a rate of 12% a year for the last 10 years. In fact, Fastenal just made it to the Dividend Aristocrat list, companies which has increased its dividend every year for the last 25 years.

I look at the slowing growth of Fastenal and the need to payout so much of the earnings to dividends plus the need to increase the dividend annually as quite stressful when compared to Simpson Mfg, where the payout ratio is only 30% and the annualized dividend increase is about been 7%. 

Bottom line, SSD has got more potential upside to be rated at a higher multiple than FAST whereas for Fast, if the business slows down too much, and they cannot increase their dividend, the stock will fall quite dramatically as the dividend investors move elsewhere.

Do you agree with my assessment ?"

269,Apple Deep Value Play,2024-04-26 19:50:11,22.0,"Heading into earnings, I can't help but think Apple is the best deep value play of the mega cap stocks out there because of its fortress balance sheet. I expect more share repurchases to be announced with earnings, which should continue to help juice EPS.

I'm not understanding why the market is ignoring the massive share repurchases the company continues to do. Apple bought back ~1.5 billion shares in the past three years alone, having spent:
- $82.6 billion in 2021
- $89.6 billion in 2022
- $79.2 billion in 2023

Last quarter they ended with $173 billion in cash/marketable securities versus $108 billion in debt. The CFO reiterated the long-term plan to go cash neutral. So with a net cash position of $65 billion, I expect Apple bought back a significant chunk of shares in Q1 and might even be a record for share repurchases last quarter.

I know iPhone growth isn't encouraging, but services continue to grow at a double digit clip. With the share repurchases and healthy growth in services, why isn't Apple trading at a higher multiple? To me it seems like a deep value play relative to the other mega cap stocks and a no brainer to buy and hold. 

Why is the market relatively so bearish on Apple?","['back', 'cash', 'grow', 'so', 'do', 'it', 'can', 'play', 'me', 'out', 'be', 'net', 'best', 'Play', 'go', 'for', 'So', 'on']",,

It doesn't, they're just not as significant as you seem to think. \~9% of shares repurchased in 3 years, that's nothing groundbreaking. In the end it's the same as a 3% dividend yield, just added onto the stock price instead of being paid out."

So yes the buybacks are great, but they are overshadowed by their organic growth.

People are bearish because the market is forward looking, they see more growth opportunities presenting themselves to MSFT, GOOG, META. The sentiment is that Apple is falling behind in the AI arms race, which I think is overblown (the arms race itself) and inaccurate (in AAPL's case).

I’m sure a lot of people will disagree with this example, but I think my point still stands… Apple is so ingrained in the culture and has such a strong brand identity… that a P/E ratio of 25 makes it a value play.

Also… don’t give me any of that bs about teens being fickle. If teens today feel iPhones are aspirational, they’ll feel the same way as adults.

307,Devolver Digital -> US Games Company 90% down but a catalogue of high quality games coming out,2024-04-25 20:41:55,24.0,"Devolver Digital is a US company trading on the UK AIM exchange. I also think it trades OTC in the US as well, they are most known for being the publishers of hotline miami.

They IPO'd 2.5 years ago and have crashed since because some of their games flopped and previous management didn't do so well. They had a huge 2022 net loss due to impairment which means they invested a lot of money into some really poor games.

What's interesting about them is they have:

* No debt
* A lot of cash
* A terribly low share price
* Management has very large stakes in the company and is incentivzed
* New management is the original founders who made it successful in the first place
* A back catalogue such as cult of the lamb which continues to produce them decent revenues
* Most importantly they have some upcoming games that could be big hits, Human Fall Flat 2, Plucky Squire (my personal favourite, it looks similar to 'It Takes Two', Baby Steps (made by the creator of 'Getting Over It' which is massive), Anger Foot (I have played the demo and it's really really fun, the soundtrack is amazing) etc.

Management has delayed the above releases to make sure they invest in them correctly so they are big hits like cult of the lamb was, i.e they need to hit an 85%+ on Metacritic and 'very positive' reviews on steam for a game to really have a chance of being big.

Devolver digital are well known for high quality games.

Some potential risks:

* They need to stop acquiring any more companies or they run the risk of destroying value by overpaying, although most games companies are at all time lows to be fair.
* They have to make sure the above games are hits, if not their stock price will tank even further.
* The stock is very illiquid, it's very hard to buy so put small limit orders in if you do decide.
* Games companies are a bit like gambling with the odds on your side, they have lumpy revenues and need hits to keep growing, obviously if these games flop it's a disaster.

318,Roast my portfolio,2024-04-26 00:28:00,26.0,"Hello all! I'm a college student who got into value investing around 2020. I've slowly been learning more as I go along, and I'd like some opinions on my portfolio

DIS-40%. This is easily my biggest investment, and for good reason. The business itself has survived through multiple financial crisis, multiple leadership crisis, and a global pandemic, and is now in a state where they can fully take advantage of the market. Their park business is one of the best businesses out there, with a great moat, solid earnings, and great margins. The linear business has shown resilience in the face of cord cutting, the DTC business is really beginning to show its fruits, and could be a real driver of growth. Even if Disney+ fails, worst case, they can make a lot bidding their content away to the highest bidders on streaming, with players like Netflix, AppleTV, and Prime Video bidding the content price up. IMO, this is still very undervalued for how good of a business it is. 

INTC-16.5%. Another great business. Their revenue and earnings slowdown mainly come from a global demand shortage for consumer CPUs, which will begin to pick up in the future. Pat Gelsinger has proven to be a great CEO while at VMWare, and the business is currently priced as if the revenue growth will only come from the foundry business. The foundry part of the business has been operating for the entirety of Intel's history losing money, it's only that now that it's independent of the CPU arm that people are focusing on it. Worst case, they spin off the foundry business and become fabless. With their connections, strong revenue, and overall dominance over the CPU market, that business will still prove to be extremely strong. 

TCEHY-13%. This is less a bet on China and more a bet on Pony Ma and his investment acumen. Pony Ma has proven himself an extremely good executive, and with the vast, diverse, strong, and high margin business that spans international markets, this is a great business to buy. China is easing restrictions and wants foreign dollars again, which is proving itself in a recent semi-rally in Chinese stocks.

CVS-10.5%. This is the business I'm the most likely to sell. I bought in because the revenue growth and overall business seems strong, but they bought a lot of that revenue growth, and the regulatory environment has turned SHARPLY against them. It seems increasingly likely that their core business will get attacked by competitors, and leadership at the company doesn't exactly spark confidence like other companies do. Increasingly seeming like a value trap. 

SOFI-10%. This is less of a bank and more of an overall financial stock. It's proven to be a great grower, and the company was trading at its TBVPS, so I bought in. Leadership knows what direction they're going in, and understand exactly how to funnel customers into their pipeline. 

BABA-8.5%. Another China bet. This comes from the overall strength of the balance sheet, the share buybacks, and the potential that BABA has in the cloud and international markets. I'd hope to see Jack Ma be allowed to come back to BABA, but that's unlikely. Still, with China easing restrictions, this company is increasingly seeming like a company people can actually invest in again. 

WMG-1%. This is more of a temporary percent. I plan on buying more in the future, but it seems like the price has been falling, so I'm waiting for more of an entry. Robert Kynci is a great executive and really helped to make YouTube what it is today. They are embracing tech more than any of the other large labels, and the business is in a state of really transforming towards the modern music market, while the other 2 major labels remain a bit stuck in their ways. Music is also an industry that is likely to see rapid growth based on the growth of Vinyl, streaming, and overall merchandising of artists. Data has continually shown that Gen-Z spends significantly more on experiences and wants to support artists, which provides a great opportunity for WMG. Don't let the temporary metrics stray you away from this business, as it's a great opportunity.

Don't put 40% in any name unless it grows there from your starter position. E.g. starter could be 25 names at 4% and one 15-20 bags. But don't start there. 

2. Your analysis of DIS shows nothing the market does not already know - outsize positions should be reserved for those with a hidden something the market is yet to discover

3. Your INTC analysis has ""great business"" and ""slowdown"" within a few words of each other. Nowhere in your analysis is any discussion of the reliance on subsidies to prop up and ""grow""

4. Your TCEHY analysis is confused: you say it is a bet on Pony Ma and end up discussing China's need for dollars? You'd be better off talking about how you think they'll monetise WeChat, how they'll meet the challenge of TikTok, how they'll leverage gaming to boost their cloud business. If I was betting on leaders like you are here, I'd be one of the funds bag holding Twitter with Elon right now

5. CVS analysis focuses on the risks - why? Because the share price is down 20% recently? If you're investing in single names you need to do what Buffett did at AMX in the face of the salad oil scandal: understand the risks and understand what the market doesn't and buy it when it's down 50%. Your analysis shows me you'll be selling low and buying the next boat that's already being pushed by a rising tide, rather than buying the one that's beached and patiently waiting for the tide that's about to come in

6. Your bullish view of SOFI means you don't discuss its purchase of banks (you criticise acquisitions elsewhere) nor its risk due to Biden's action on student loans (you mention ss a negative the regulation changes facing CVS, but not here?). You are betraying your biases. Investing should be done in a very cold way, applying the same standards everywhere. What are the risks facing this company? Why isn't it making money consistently? You don't answer the basics. Better off in an ETF that invests in the theme you bought this for. 

7. BABA is ""another China bet"" - I thought you said TCEHY wasn't a China bet? Again, your spitting what everyone knows: cloud, international. Surprised you didn't mention AI. If you want a China theme, you can get it via an ETF, but by punting in two names you're taking a risk of unknown proportion. You might come back in three years and your 22% in these two names has doubled and is now 30% of the portfolio. You'll be patting yourself on the back, and wondering why they aren't 44% of the portfolio seeing as they doubled...

8. You're betting only 1% of your portfolio on WMG? which is trading at about 20x EV/EBITDA? This is so out of character: with that level of ovevaluation I'd expect this to be at least 20% of your portfolio

I'd be liquidating everything and investing in low cost thematic ETFs. Find one for streaming (DIS, WMG), find one for China and Emerging Markets (TCEHY, BABA), find one for fin tech (TCEHY, SOFI), find one for healthcare (CVS), funds one for semis (INTC). That's five so 20% in each. And next time you see a company you like, find an ETF for it and make sure it's not an already existing theme in your portfolio and trim your existing winners to invest in the new one. Keep doing that until you have enough ETFs that don't duplicate risks. Rebalance regularly, trimming winners and adding to losers. 

You asked for free opinions, and these only cost 2 cents."

1. Technology has made visual entertainment cheap. Anyone with a smartphone can make something amusing or informative. Lots of people are doing this on YouTube or TikTok. Disney et al used to have a huge market because of a lack of options.

2. Word of mouth matters far more than marketing. The advantages of being a huge corporation rather than an indie studio in terms of getting an audience in has shrunk

3. Audiences are far more aware of which movies are OK or good from social media and avoiding them in theaters and waiting for streaming. They are only going to movies that their friends rave about.

4. There is growing international competition in entertainment and we are all now aware from various pieces of media that audiences are open to Korean or Japanese cinema and TV. Much of this seems to be made more efficiently than hollywood.

5. The parks depend on producing great work, great characters and stories that resonate. Disney is failing to do this."

The chips act is good for Intel, but they'd be in a good position regardless of it, as consumer CPUs remain the largest chip market, even with the Ai boom(every computer needs one, every server needs many).

As for Disney, this is merely a temporary rut. Every entertainment company is pumping out garbage. Warner Bros had a crapshoot with DC. Many of the other entertainment companies haven't produced much notable. Yeah, Disney's recent slate has sucked, and they've certainly done a poor job with the film IP of Star wars, but guess what? That's all temporary. Those are things that are incredibly easy to fix. And Disney executives have recognized this, and are actively making shifts. Disney understands that they'll need to begin production of original IP, or pull from other source material(like WB with Dune), and eventually they will. As for value, looking purely at the P/E ratio is a bad idea for a company that is enduring temporary losses. DTC is going to be profitable this year, and with that a return of higher margins."

363,FLIC: A Steady Performer in the Beat Down Regional Banking Sector,2024-04-25 11:17:43,28.0,"
**Key Insights:**  
FLIC has shown remarkable resilience during major financial crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the recent 2023 turmoil in the regional banking sector. Despite these strengths, its stock has been overlooked and is currently trading at levels similar to those seen in 2008-2009. When getting into the weeds you'll see FLIC has tons of liquidity, zero doubtful rated loans on the books, rock solid dividend yield and history, insiders consistently buying shares, corporate buy backs, owns the real estate of at least 20 of their 40 branch locations (in NYC/Long Island), upcoming earnings (after the bell today) and dirt-cheap options (low volume though so be careful).

* **Aggressive Buybacks:** With a continuous $15 million buyback program and hefty insider purchases, there's a clear signal that those in the know believe in FLIC’s future.

* **Affordable Options:** The options market for FLIC is invitingly priced, providing a cost-effective way to potentially profit from future stock movements, just be careful as they are low volume typically. Hopefully we will see an uptick with earnings today.

* **Proven Stability:** FLIC has navigated past financial storms with strategy and grace, bolstered by recent tech upgrades in fintech and cybersecurity.

* **Financial Health:** Solid capital ratios underpin its ability to maintain operations and seek growth, enhancing its appeal as a robust investment.

* **Attractive Dividend Yield:** For those looking for reliable income, FLIC’s strong track record of dividends is a major draw, especially if you’ve been burned by riskier bets this week. At first glance the yield at nearly 8% may appear unsustainable but when doing you DD you'll see that it is a sustainable number and the stock is just cheap at the moment.

* **Valuation and Earnings:** Given the ongoing buybacks, insider enthusiasm, and strong fundamentals, my target price of around $17.40 based on a P/E of 15 and an EPS of $1.16 seems achievable for this stock before the end of the year. FLIC's annual report pegs the book value at $16.83/share which you can see in their SEC filing and I believe once the regional banking sector rebounds FLIC will get right back to $17+. 

# Conclusion:

FLIC’s blend of strategic buybacks, insider confidence, and significant movement on small volume, alongside its solid financials and undervalued options, make it an intriguing prospect for those looking for a mix of safety and growth in the financial sector.

But bottom line: it's undervalued and the company has been around 100 years.

Things going for AMC:

* Revenue has increased YoY since the pandemic
* It's nearing profitability again
* AMC is taking market share from other cinema chains
* The CEO is a seasoned player, and while people might not like what he does always, he generally knows what he's doing. E.g. Taylor Swift eras tour, the APE saga where he raised money through issuance even when shareholders didn't want to let him etc.

Reasons for pause:

* It has a massive, unsustainable debt load - 4.5B total, of which \~3B is due in 2 years. They will need to refinance, but the terms will likely be onerous.
* Liabilities exceed assets by 1.8B, so the company is basically at the mercy of the senior lenders
* The writers' and actors' strikes did a number on box office revenue for at least two quarters - so far
* Management has no qualms raising money through share issuance, which has diluted shareholders down the drain (\~20X over 3 years). There's a $250M issuance underway which would dilute by another 25%
* The CEO does dumb shit like buying a gold mine, time to time

When it comes to DCF modeling, in order to estimate Free cash flows it is often recommended to use NOPAT as a starting point.

My problem is that depending on the textbook and the internet resource there are slightly different formulas available for NOPAT or recommendations on which formula to use.

Investopedia & Corporate Finance Institute: NOPAT = Operating Income \* (1 - Tax Rate)

WallStreetPrep & BIWS: NOPAT = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate)

BIWS also gives you the long formula

I am somewhat confused.

After 15 years assume the revenue will be $0. Also assume 100% of the profit can be taken out of the business in cash each year (which will have to be taxed).

While owning a melting ice cube sucks, assume you have minimal work to do to keep the business running. Say 2-3 hours per week.

I don't think these numbers tell us enough to make a decent valuation. I would insist on knowing more about the number of employees, their likely attitudes, and/or the options I would have to replace them.

For example, if this is an ""old school"" business with a decently comfortable manager, then the valuation could be higher as we milk after tax profit from that depreciation set up. Updating technology is a reasonable way to keep this business alive without having to replace. 

But if it is any sort of business that requires technical knowledge, then the risk of losing key employees is too high.

i think you got a bargain,

i value it between 313 to 450k depending on discount rate,

assumption:

EBIDTA is proxy for cash flow generated

Depreciation of 13k annually is proxy for the annual capex needed to run the business

So for year one, free cash is Cash flow of 100k less Capex = 87k, discounted to present is

||Year1 / FCF at Present Value |
|:-|:-|
|15% discount rate|75.65|
|6% discount rate|82.08|

OP would need to give a lot more information about the business to get a relatively precise answer.

Also, assuming an entry multiple of 3-5x EV/EBITDA, common in PE, OP would have bought the business for 450K, which implies a 3,22% IRR to break even.

Revenue - COGS - operating = EBIT

EBIT * (1 - Tx Rate) = EBIAT

535,TDM – a wrong plantation bet,2024-04-25 03:39:22,37.0,"I originally viewed TDM as a plantation Group with a healthcare arm. About 17 years ago, the healthcare segment only accounted for about 16% of the Group revenue. The Group plantation operations then was mainly in Malaysia and this accounted for a large part of the Group’s revenue. 

The Group decided to expand it plantations segment by venturing to Indonesia. It took several years to get this going such that the maiden revenue from the Indonesian plantation was only in 2013. By then  the Group had “..earmarked that the growth of the plantation operations will be in Kalimantan.” 

But things began to go wrong with the Indonesian operations soon after. The losses and impairments got so bad that the Group announced its plans to sell the Indonesian assets in 2019.  By 2023 it was still trying to complete the sale of its Indonesian assets. 

If not for the healthcare segment, which had grown to account for 56 % of the Group’s revenue in 2023, TDM would be in a worse shape.

Moral of the story? Beware of companies announcing expanding into foreign countries as the Malaysian experience may not always be transferable. 

Given the poor plantation segment performance, the market took a dim view of the company despite a growing healthcare segment. I guess the market is still waiting for TDM to prove that it can recover from the Indonesian lesson. 

Refer to “Is TDM a value trap?” if you want to bet on its turnaround.

**A Value Investor’s Guide to Navigating Technology Disruption**

By Mark Iong 

April 23, 2024

https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/value-investing-technology-stocks-s-curve-40230f6a?mod=djem\_b\_Weekly%20Barrons%20feed%20for%20last%2024%20hours

Tectonic shifts occur more frequently in technology than in other sectors, so investors need to be wary of tech companies that are approaching the mature stage of what is known as the S-curve. 

This curve, shaped like the letter “s,” is a visual representation of the growth path that technology companies tend to follow. It begins with slow initial growth (the bottom of the “s”) then moves with rapid upward growth as adoption takes off, finally arriving at the plateau stage, at which businesses become increasingly commoditized, growth becomes saturated, and returns trend lower. Companies in the plateau stage of the S-curve often find it difficult to recapture their momentum, particularly in the tech sector, where megatrends tend to be irreversible. Consider the evolution of computer technology from mainframes to PCs and servers, to mobile and the cloud—each development a paradigm shift that didn’t reverse course and that rendered the previously used technology less favored and eventually obsolete. With artificial intelligence, a similar seismic shift is now under way.

As value investors, we naturally gravitate to the uppermost section of the S-curve. Quality companies often become undervalued by the market at this stage, providing the opportunity to buy at a significant discount relative to their long-term intrinsic value. But we need to be highly selective, identifying businesses that have the competitive moats and defensive characteristics that will extend the upward slope of the S-curve into the new technology frontier instead of entering the plateau stage.

By contrast, mature tech companies risk succumbing to the “innovator’s dilemma,” a term coined by the late academic and business consultant Clayton Christensen to describe how companies cling to their established markets and protect profit margins instead of focusing on innovations that might disrupt their core businesses but also open up new opportunities for growth. As new entrants exploit this complacency and carve out a niche in the market, legacy businesses eventually fall victim to a shrinking profit pool, as capital flows to new entrants that offer products with more power, efficiency, scalability, and affordability.

Without innovations to alter their weakening fundamental outlook, the old guard may see profits dwindle and their valuations deflate. It is a slow bleed, a value trap that lulls investors with seemingly cheap metrics but masks a bleak future. We feel it is important to avoid these long-term secular losers that might seem statistically cheap based on today’s valuation. A company trading at a depressed price-to-earnings multiple, for example, could be “cheap” for a reason, reflecting a declining business where valuation could remain low indefinitely or worse, continue to compress.

There are several important traits we look for when evaluating maturing technology businesses. They need to be innovative with an eye toward the future, developing new products and services that can position them for the next paradigm shift. Management needs to be willing to disrupt themselves, even if doing so risks revenue and earnings losses in the near term. We witnessed several companies created in the early days of the internet, for instance, that successfully navigated their way into mobile computing in the 2010s and are now attempting to repeat the same playbook as they make strides in the AI era of the 2020s.

Platform companies are probably the best examples of businesses that are most adept at steering through disruptions. Such companies have an extensive ecosystem of first-party software and hardware products and third-party partners that rely on their platforms. Cloud computing exemplifies this dynamic today, where several players control the majority of the market and are essentially the gatekeepers for all things artificial intelligence and cloud computing. In technology subsectors such as semiconductors and enterprise software, we seek those firms with durable business models and robust product road maps that can serve as the foundational layers of the next megatrend.

Technology companies primed for long-term success understand that disruption is a marathon, not a sprint. Conversely, those that struggle to adapt and innovate are the ones most likely to stumble. Value investors who recognize this could be primed to take advantage of outperformance in the tech sector.

568,CORMEDIX (CRMD): A deep Value Opportunity! TLDR at the Bottom Revised,2024-04-23 23:30:24,41.0,"* Cormedix (CRMD) is a biotech company that primarily focuses on the prevention of Catheter Related Blood infections with their leading product, Defencath. Catheter Related Blood Infections plagues the End Stage Disease Population. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease Institute, nearly 808,000 people suffer from this ailment, and approximately 69% are on dialysis([https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:\~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease#:~:text=Nearly%20808%2C000%20people%20in%20the,31%25%20with%20a%20kidney%20transplant.)))
* Defencath is a catheter lock solution that eliminates both gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections that develop within the Catheter. Defencath is composed of a solution of taurolidine and heparin that effectively reduces the CRBSI events in this vulnerable population.
* However, this population has a catheter that is surgically implanted into their patient and its called a, “Central Venous Catheter.” This type of catheter is placed near a large center vein most commonly an internal jugular or subclavian. In layman terms, it’s placed near the patient's heart, implanted on the patient to administer medication or to administer hemo-dialysis.
* The results of their Lock-100 Study had 71% reduction in CRBIS compared to the control (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37678222/). Additionally, They rejected the null hypothesis by a P value of .0006 to such a degree that it would only occur in 1 in 10,000 tries due to sheer random chance. Therefore, the phase III study was halted.
* There are approximately 250,000k CRBIS events per year according to this site,([https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:\~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/catheter-infection#:~:text=Catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20remain%20among%20the%20top%20three,catheter%2Drelated%20infections%20is%20approximately%2014%%2C%20and%2019))

* Lastly: on April 15, 2024, Cormedix Celebrated their commercial launch for the in-patient setting, and expect to lauch out-patient by July 1st 2024.

* T**he institutional ownership** acquired about 33.94% of total shares on the open market with Black Rock Inc leading with 3,507,695 Shares held as of 12/31/23. Numora Holding Inc, comes in second at 2,946, 552 shares, then Vanguard at 2,825,335 million shares, and lastly Elliot Investment Management L.P., comes in at 1,550, 523 million shares. See all institutional ownership here, ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crmd/institutional-holdings))
* Y**ou’re probably wondering at this point, how does Defencath work, and what are the Projected vials to be sold?** Cormedix projects to sell 3.4 million vials on the inpatient side and over 37 million vials on the out-patient side. The growth potential is HUGE!
* **With such volume you’re probably wondering at this point how precisely does the product work…** Well, Every Time a patient receives hemo-dialysis the catheter must be flushed with the Defencath solution before and after. That is approximately two vials per patient per visit with the average patient getting about 3 treatments per-week, out of 550,000 patients on hemodialysis.
* Cormedix plans, and is on track to launch Defencath for out-patient setting on July 1, 2024.
* Cormedix Plans on expanding its usage and application of Defencath to other populations that already have CVCs, like Oncology.
* The current short interest as of 3/31/24 is 34 million dollars or approx. 8.2 million shares.
* **Marketing Plan**: There are 5 major companies that control the out-patient setting, and two of them control 70% of the market. Remember, Out-patient is projected to sell appx. 37 million vials!
* The Projected market impact of the stock is incredible, and understanding the product shows the extreme value it holds.
* **Debt:** the company has NO debt.
* **Market Exclusivity:** CRMD has 10.5 years market exclusivity because it's a qualified infectious diseases, and it's a new chemical entity. And it’s intellectual property is extended until April 15, 2024. See ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-announces-issuance-of-u-s-patent-covering-lead-product-defencath/))
* **WHY WILL CRMD EXPLODE SOONER THAN ANALYISTS EXPECTATIONS?**
* The out-patient setting is dominated by 5 major out-patient facilities, and once it received it's NDA every medical Journal posted the NDA approval AND JOE, MENTIONED THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING TO BOTH IN-PATIENT AND OUT PATIENT FACILITIES AT March 12th Earnings Call ""March 12, 2024 ""Joe Todisco, CorMedix CEO, commented, “I am excited about the Company’s recent progress as we have scaled up activity ahead of our commercial launch in April. **We have received significant inbound interest from both inpatient facilities as well as outpatient dialysis providers with respect to DefenCath, and we are actively engaged in customer discussions in both settings of care**"" ([https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:\~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)](https://cormedix.com/cormedix-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-and-provides-business-update/#:~:text=Conference%20Call%20Scheduled%20for%20Today,%C2%AE%20(taurolidine%20and%20heparin)))
* **Competition:** There is no Drug on the market that prevents CRBIs the way Cormedix does and there is absolutely no competition.
* The CTXR guys will say we’re competition but we’re not. Mino-lock salvages an already infected Catheter. It’s a reactive medicine opposed to Defencath which is Preventative.
   * The preventative application allows for such high sales values in such an exclusive market.
* **CREDIT TO Fretwizard125,** “Good post and summary of what’s in play here. I’ve been in CRMD since 2018 and Have been accumulating. Have a multi-hundred thousand dollar position and am waiting for this to explode. With TDAPA we could see 70-80% market penetration really quickly, (1-2 years).
   * The Wholesale Acquisition Price FROM CRMD and approved by CMS is $250/vial. They will likely offer discounts to the providers to adopt and recognize revenue too. But even with a 70% discount for a vial potential revenue is insane.
   * Quick math $75/vial x20,000,000 vials (50% penetration) =$1.5b. Yes billion, with a B.
   * This does not include other indications they are trying to expand into including oncology and TPN. Oncology market is 1.5x the size of hemodialysis. This is a long term hold with literally the most perfect commercialization setup I’ve ever seen.”--- Credit to Fretwizard 125
* Projected Price: Low $9.00 per share, medium is $12.00 per share; high of $19.00 per share within the next year. I believe we’re going to hit the 9s in july and potentially hit 20s before December.
* **TLDR:** Cormedix(CRMD) Is Deep Value. It hit’s all of the marks. CRMD is poised for huge growth over the next year, reaching over a billion sales. The market is unique, and they’re going to be the standard of care. The stock is primed to explode at any day. I believe the stock will be at least 25$ per share by March 2025 if not $35-$40 per share. 5 Major companies control 100% of the out-patient market. They’ll be announcing contracts in the coming weeks. I think we can hit 12$ before the out-patient launch in July, that’s my opinion.
* **All RISK IS ELIMINATED!**
* **POSITION:**
   * 50 call contracts $6 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K Exp. June 21
   * 50 call Contracts $7 strike, .10 cents per share, 10$ per K exp June 21
   * 3750 Shares average $4.15.

If a judge rules that addition of taurolidine to a lock solution is the key innovation here, then they could overturn some of the patent protection the company supposedly has.  
  
A good example of this kind of thing is what happened to AMRN. That company had a killer phase 3, got approval for a massive indication, and had a high price tag, but lost the patent defensibility and Vascepa went down the drain.

The main reason they have gotten inbound interest is because this  can be a standard of care product.

I had forgotten about those two products because they’re not a threat. So in the name of transparency, I will elaborate!

Centeral Venus Catheters are surgically implanted, right, so between the insertion point of the flesh and catheter Cleargard has a patch I believe. That’s one way a person can get CRBIs.

They also have a CAP to seal the catheter to prevent things from getting in.

However, the catheter still must be sanitized between each hemodialysis before and after.

So that’s where Defencath replaces Heparin because it’s 21% more effective; and defencath targets both gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi’s.

It’s important to realize that many of these companies develop product specific solutions, and that regardless of caps, and patches biofilm will still develop within the catheter which is why defencath is necessary.

Lastly, again, Mino-lock is only used after a Catheter is already infected. So if Defencath fails then mino-lock is used.

Understanding the distinctions in these products ensures understanding the deep value cormedix holds with their Defencath CLS (Catheter Lock Solution) .

It seems OP has thoroughly explained the industry and the market in great detail here.

>If you think the banking/financial industry is hard, try evaluating pharma.

Yeah that is why its important to listen to experts in the field who understand it. If only people who understood pharma invested in pharma stocks no one in pharma stocks would make money.

> It's just too hard for people that genuinely don't understand the biology/chemistry behind the drugs, alongside the industry as a whole.

You don't need to understand the biology/chemistry behind the drugs in order to invest in these companies I am sure it would be helpful but not necessary. You don't need to be a computer scientist to invest into google or apple. I am sure Warren Buffet doesn't understand how microprocessors work but he has a giant stake in apple.  

>Too many people buy into pharma drugs because they see value, but the industry is just so hard, so anyone without a lot of expertise in the field should simply avoid it.

This could be said about any industry though. I think you are talking about the risky nature of biotech stocks vs other stocks which I would say there is a reasonable case there. However a lot of the risk in this stock has decreased due to the factors mentioned in op's DD. such as FDA approval, TDAPA approval and clinical trials. The company signed a contract before the product was officially launched. I think that is a sign that the stock is going to follow the trajectory of OP's DD"

It actually does. Most people don't own a tesla but yet they invest in tesla, apple, or google. Most people don't understand how certain securities work like bitcoin or Ethereum but invest in it all the time.  

Moreover, had you read the DD, you'd realize that they have 10.5 year exclusivity plus another TPO for intellectual property until 2042.... Yes, had you double checked the DD and the sources, you'd realize they have enough money to break even via their expectations this December.

I wrote up an article that provides a framework for evaluating and comparing quality compounders like Hershey using key metrics and analyzing long-term trends in the financials of the business. By interpreting financial data visually in the key areas outlined below, we can more easily identify businesses with the potential for sustained growth and value creation over the long term.

* Price and Volatility: Understand the risk profile and market perception of a company
* Income Statement and Balance Sheet: Understand the company's earnings, assets, and financial health.
* Valuation: Assess the value of a company relative to its peers and industry.
* Return of Value: Explore a company's strategy for returning value to shareholders.
* Industry Comparison: Benchmark a company against its direct competitors. 

 [How Hershey Can Be Your Golden Ticket for Evaluating Investment Opportunities](https://quartest.substack.com/p/how-hershey-can-be-your-golden-ticket-90b)

I have been developing this financial framework for analyzing stocks for quite some time now and thought you all might be interested in it. I would also greatly appreciate your feedback on the analysis and my writing.

&#x200B;

TLDR Summary of my Hershey Analysis:

Hershey's consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth have historically warranted a premium valuation to the market. The financial strength and resilience of the business have consistently placed Hershey as a top performing in the consumer staples sector. These returns have been well justified, as Hershey has continually demonstrated efficient uses capital, as evidenced by its high return on invested capital, equity, and assets. Its attractive return strategy, including dividend payouts and share buybacks, have provided a sound value return for shareholders.  
However, Hershey has recently been faced with perceived challenges in maintaining sustainable earnings growth in an inflationary environment with skyrocketing cocoa prices and tough competition from snacking rivals. While Hershey's five-year historical EPS growth lags behind some competitors and has recently slowed, its valuation has potentially come down to reasonable levels given the quality of the business and its strong cash flow generation. Nevertheless, Hershey's ability to navigate external factors including  market dynamics and further cost fluctuations in its inputs, will be crucial to the company's long-term success.

The cocoa situation is a lolapalooza event. Combinations of several factors over several years leading to an amplified outcome. 

Plants were not replanted in 2020, and there’s been mismanagement in governments of growing regions in Africa. So you get 1 in a century rainfall last year with El Niño impacting global weather patterns and that was the catalyst. Now you have some regions with swollen shoot disease in 30% of crops. They’ll still produce but have very low yields until replaced. This is in large due to the fact that there’s been aging plants out there not replaced as they should have been.

There’s other regions in the world such as South America where cocoa comes from to begin with, that have suitable growing conditions. There’s also climate controlled solutions which would take more capital but remains an option.

Additionally, at 11% cocoa use, Hersheys chocolate is 1% above the legal threshold to call it chocolate. This also gives them a low cost advantage on their peers. Boutique chocolate goes about 40%-60%. Cadbury is 20%+, M&M’s Mars flagship chocolate is about 20%. Anything semi-sweet is in the 30%+ range.

There’s a variety of hedges Hershey has in regards to cocoa. This commodity supply crunch isn’t their first rodeo. They’ll do just fine in the long run with plenty of levers at their disposal to deal with this short term noise."

Cacao growing has been in trouble for a good while. Came up frequently in my undergrads (‘14-‘18), at a good ag uni. It’s a pretty sensitive tree with regards to diseases that doesn’t like it too hot or too cold or too dry or too humid, so anyclimate change is too much and you have to keep adapting if you’re in that business as a result. Moreover it is an ‘orphan crop’. Much of the capital is not put into growing it as the farmers are often poor smallholders (or medium sized ventures which may or may not rely on slave labor) with little capital and the big companies just buy through intermediaries anyway. So all the capital is downstream from the growing, so to say. This, plus the fact that a grower can’t move his land uphill as the climate warms, is all very stratifying. Outputs thus keep falling."

As UCACashFlow pointed out, Hershey is very well positioned in their Candy, Mints and Gum (CMG) segment with strong brands and supply advantages.

However, it's not suitable for the majority of retail investors.

I generally wouldn't recommend active stock picking for most retail investors. The more you learn about it, the clearer it becomes that active investing isn't the best strategy for the majority. Instead, retail investors should focus on passive investing through diversified ETFs, understanding risks, diversification, and proper portfolio or asset allocation. Most importantly, they should get to know their own investor behavior.

Understanding one's risk tolerance and creating a long-term, sustainable investment strategy that one can live with is crucial. For those still keen on learning about stock picking, it might be wise to limit this to about 5% of the portfolio. This can help mitigate the risk of capital loss while still allowing for significant learning outcomes in comparison to their broader market portfolio.

I emphasize passive investment because there is strong empirical evidence showing that the market outperforms 80-95% of institutional investors after fees over any 10-year rolling period. This trend is even more pronounced over longer periods."

679,"3 Timeless Investment Lessons from Benjamin Graham, the Father of Value Investing",2024-04-22 13:03:02,51.0,"This week, I feel compelled to acquaint those unfamiliar with Benjamin Graham, the cornerstone figure of value investing. 

Regarded as the “Father” of this discipline, his seminal works, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, serve as indispensable guides for investors. Graham’s principles laid the groundwork for the legends of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and continue to inspire legions of aspiring investors.

>  “The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.”  - Benjamin Graham

# The Teachings of Benjamin Graham
Graham imparted numerous invaluable lessons, but today, I wish to highlight three that I consider pivotal for enhancing one’s investment acumen:

## 1. Invest in the company, not the share price
When we purchase just one stock of a listed company, it is no different from buying the entire business. That one share gives us ownership rights of the company, including a proportionate share of the company’s profits. So we are NOT buying a share but rather a company.

It may seem like I am stating the obvious. Yet, even today, people trade stocks because of their volatility rather than the underlying fundamentals of that business, and even “investors” quickly overlook the basics of a company because they don’t want to miss out on the latest trend.

While there are stories of success trading stock and people retiring early because of  “the next big thing,” there are far more stories of going broke due to the same strategies. Unfortunately, those stories are seldom in the media, posted on social media or spoken about over the dinner table.

If we want to be successful investors, we must understand the company we are buying, how it generates revenue, the costs to run it, and the risks involved. The more we know, the more confident we will be when we invest, and although that doesn’t guarantee success, it dramatically improves it.

## 2. Invest at less than it is worth.
Graham, being an investor during the Great Depression, was always acutely aware of the risks of investing in the stock market and how easily fortunes could be lost. Therefore, he believed in investing with a Margin of Safety, which means buying shares in a company at a discount to its true worth or intrinsic value.

In Investing Chronicles above, we discussed the historical average P/E of the S&P 500, which is around 20.5, meaning that, on average, the price of the S&P 500 is roughly 20x the combined earnings of its constituents. If we assume this is the fair value of the index, then whenever the index is trading below 20x earnings, we have a margin of safety. The lower the P/E, the greater the margin of safety.

Similarly, for a company, once we have analysed the business and its economic drivers, we should be in a decent position to derive an estimate of its intrinsic value. If we believe the company to be worth $100 million and the market currently values it at $150 million, why would we purchase shares?

However, the opportunity is evident if that company has a current value (market cap) of $75 million. More importantly, buying it at $75 million provides us with a safety net because our calculations might be off (almost guaranteed they are), and the company’s actual value could be $80 million. Of course, the actual value could be $120 million, but you get the point!

## 3. Let the Market Come to You
Besides “Margin of Safety”, Graham is also famous for coining the term “Mr Market”, referring to the bipolar nature of the stock market.

In the stock exchange, as with all things involving human beings, emotions get involved, and one could argue that when money is involved, we get highly emotional. The higher the emotional charge, the higher the capacity to act irrationally.

Euphoria will likely occur when share prices appreciate and money is made. Market participants throw caution to the wind during these times, feeling nothing can go wrong. As a result, investors overpay for assets. We can see this currently, at least in my opinion, as certain tech stocks are valued as though the stars have aligned.

Of course, the opposite is true too, when fear takes grip. During these times, irrational, pessimistic market participants convince themselves that they will lose all their money and sell while running for the hills, screaming, “The sky is falling”. During these times, valuations can plummet to illogical lows.

Our goal is to remove our emotions when investing.

Investing in the long term is a fantastic strategy because it allows us to ignore short-term market noise and fluctuations, especially if we understand what we have bought. We are in a hugely advantageous position to take advantage of Mr Market, buying when fear is at its peak and selling to the overzealous buyer.

# Summary
So be more like the Father of Investing:

- Know what you are buying,
- Know what it is worth, and
- Only buy it when you can get a substantial discount.

If you can master the above, you are well on your way to being better than most.

For example: P/E is a good ration to use for your examples, but I doubt Ben Graham would have focused on that necessarily. But even if he did and I’m not aware, you also have to take the context of the P/E into account….

I haven’t looked at it but let’s say you are correct about historic P/E being at 20x. Okay. But that was before companies were buying back shares (and retiring those shares) like crazy. That means there are less shares of quality companies to go around. While in a vacuum the P/E should not change with shares bought back, you aren’t considering the DEMAND for those shares staying the same or even increasing. There are plenty of research papers arguing that due to the prevalence of share buybacks we may be entering a world where higher P/Es are standard, at least for a while. 

Also, I would say that China’s current low P/E is NO indication of “cheapness” but rather of lack of quality and higher risk."

However there is a basis that a company's earnings multiple can usually not go below a certain factor. So when you buy directly comparable companies at 20x multiples vs 30x multiples, and the price falls for both, you're more likely to lose more money on the 30x multiples company than on the 20x multiples company simply because you can assume a baseline at constant earnings.

Not necessarily true. If 2 companies in the same industry have dramatically different valuations, then there's usually many reasons for that difference. It could be very well the case that the lower price multiple company is more risky during a time of duress. For example, jp morgan vs all the smaller/medium sized banks in the last couple of years.

. . . . . . 

Once known mostly for building PC add-on graphics cards for gamers, Nvidia has transformed its graphics processing units, or GPUs, into the beating heart of the AI revolution, powering the creation of large language models and running the inference software that leverages them in data centers around the world. Nvidia has been nearly alone on the field, with more than 90% market share.  
  
But fresh competition is coming—from companies big and small—and the battle will be fierce. The stakes couldn’t be bigger: Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has sized the AI chip market at $400 billion by 2027. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has projected a $1 trillion opportunity by 2030. That’s almost twice the size of the entire chip industry in 2023.

. . . . . . 

A few weeks ago, Nvidia launched its latest marvel, the Blackwell B200 GPU, which CEO Huang says dramatically outperforms the H100. With Blackwell, Nvidia raises the bar for its rivals. Nvidia for the foreseeable future will sell as many Blackwells as it can make—or, to be more precise, that partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing can make for it.  
  
Huang has said Blackwell GPUs will cost $30,000 to $40,000 apiece. The current H100s sell in the same range. But the chip prices aren’t the whole story. AI customers want to run workloads in the shortest time, at the lowest cost, with the highest accuracy and reliability, drawing as little power as possible. There are a number of companies that think they can do that as well—or better—than Nvidia.

. . . . . 

Nvidia’s rivals fall into three groups: big chip makers, cloud computing vendors, and venture-backed start-ups. With a $1 trillion market at stake, this won’t be winner-take-all. It isn’t game over. It’s game on.  
  
Nvidia’s most obvious challengers are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.

Just read a report tracking Hedge Fund net longs and short exposures.  $VFC is ranked 6th most shorted s&p 500 stock, and certainly it makes sense why that's the case, but the turnaround + short-covering is going to be beautiful. This stock is 100% in oversold territory. 

The North Face brand is huge in Europe and will only grow larger in the US given they are establishing a new commercial organization and regional platform in Americas region, replicating the strategy used in the EMEA which grew the north face. Not only does it have significant market share in outdoors, climbing, it only has a growing market share in street fashion and casualwear, and the inner-city kids in europe love them. Their parkas and puffers are also deeply embedded in europe rap/drill/grime culture.

Here's a recent quote from Bracken Darrell :   
We have a team working on about five different strategies such that they (The North Face) are relevant 365 days a year, at least outdoors, not just when you're not on the mountain in winter. We tend to skew more males than females, so we have ample opportunities for women.

TNF growing   
Vans bottoming and turning back to growth

I think it's worth keeping on your radar, but sustained high interest rates are their kryptonite. Add on the current conflict and split opinions the impact of GLP-1s on their business, they may struggle for some time.

Regarding interest rates, their products are largely financed when purchased. The selling price in the US is about 2-2.5x that OUS. Payback periods are quick based on an ASP of $130k but high rates are still deterring purchases. Lenders have also been slower in lending. INMDs clientele are also not wealthy. Average income of $60k. They are sensitive to higher interest rates.

Geopolitical risk will be there for some time but the US being right off the coast should keep things from getting out of control. All 3 of INMDs primary manufacturers (outsourced) are in Israel. They have a buffer from the borders but Israel is so small that it may not matter much if things do escalate. GLP-1s in my view are not an issue. Overall, it should boost demand.

Laser-based products have an installed base of 40-50k in the US. IMND was at around 7.5k at the end of 2022. INMDs products do the same things as lasers (for what they market them for), but better. They are finding new indications (ENT, Ophthalmology, Women's and Men's health) to increase their TAM and have a pile of cash they will have to do something with. All of this with strong IP protection through this decade and likely into the 2030s. Long-term, I think they recover just fine. Short-term may be ugly though."

Edit:

Obviously the things you added to your comment are horrendous. If the first were true, it would be horrendous - but 'their own government officials' is not a very specific source. Like you, I hope it is not true. The second mischaracterizes the situation. Israel does not have the world's most powerful military, and the US (which does) is not a combatant in Gaza. It is heartbreaking nonetheless. The fact remains that Hamas started this war by massacring and kidnapping civilians, and they prolong it by exploiting their asymmetric 'advantage' of hiding amongst the civilian population.

I screen for quality first, then put the stocks on a watchlist and wait until they become cheaper to own.

If you are simply taking below average P/E you may also not do well unless you can demonstrate this would be part of a comprehensive strategy and the chosen stocks are just examples of companies making the cut.

If you just want 10 names and want to talk about them individually as to what makes each value, then you need to dig into what value managers are buying: what's Buffett buying and why, what's Chris Bloomstran holding and why, etc. You need to find value ETFs manage by active managers and ask why they are in: what's in DEEP, etc. You need to look at investment write ups in Seeking Alpha, VIC, etc., and see which resonate with you"

I'm not saying dividends are bad. There are many quality dividend stocks that grow and pay dividends. Those are much better than ones that shrink and pay dividends. The key is finding good dividend stocks.

My personal opinion - I think 3M, T, and VZ have too much baggage. They could rebound, but I feel like over 10 years VOO will likely do much better.

Good luck."

I would recommend you read [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) to learn about the concepts around valuing a company. (Investopedia is a great resource, and I’d recommend exploring their site.)

If you’re just looking to get your feet wet, it’s fine to buy some individual names — and your choices aren’t terrible. Otherwise, if your intention is to invest with a long time horizon (5+ years), I’d strongly recommend the majority of qyour portfolio being a couple broad, low-cost index funds — VOO is a terrific choice.

You can explore the various options for ETFs using a tool like [this fund screener](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-screener).

If picking stocks, you should be able to explain your thesis to someone. You should also be aware of the company’s fundamentals. This takes time and effort, but is essential. I would strongly recommend listening to earnings calls: They provide important insights into a company and its leadership. The Quartr app is a great tool for this.

EDIT: I see you invested in some of these companies because they pay a dividend. Might be worth reading up on the considerations. See [this article](https://www.britannica.com/money/what-is-a-stock-dividend) on how it is not free money, and [this one](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082015/3-biggest-misconceptions-dividend-stocks.asp) on misconceptions."

If that doesn't appeal to you, just go with something straightforward like VTI or VOO. Try to keep individual stock picking to no more than 5% of your total investments.

As a beginner, it's easy to make expensive mistakes and challenging to consistently outperform the market over the long term. Don't take my word for it; there's strong evidence showing that simply holding onto market indices beats 80-95% of managed mutual funds over a decade, and the results are even more pronounced over longer periods.

At this stage, you likely don't have the expertise needed to effectively manage the risks associated with picking stocks. It's better to grow your wealth passively and maybe experiment with a small portion of your portfolio to get a feel for the market. This way, you minimize potential losses, which saves more of your capital for investing once you've mastered the basics and developed a solid strategy.

Picking individual stocks is tough. It involves a deep dive into financial reports, understanding business models, analyzing fundamentals, forecasting growth, and estimating the true value of a company. This process requires a lot of reading, a solid grasp of financial principles, disciplined effort, and considerable time. Plus, it comes with increased risks like overconcentration in certain stocks or sectors and other market-related vulnerabilities."

The only question mark is Pfizer. Yes it's at multi-year lows but hard to call - needs to find its next major revenue source post pandemic.

Pfizer had some challenges with its answer to Ozempic, and though some recent approvals from the EU have been coming through, nothing's quite on the same scale.

The issue is that its balance sheet isn't the strongest. That said, given the company's track record and extensive pipeline, you'd also not want to bet against it - it might well end up doing great.

897,Is ARM a good buy?,2024-04-23 08:29:44,61.0,"I was thinking about buying, or starting to DCA, ARM during this dip.

Does anyone have an opinion about their position in the semiconductor market right now?

If I understand correctly they mostly lisence their architecture but are very successful with it especially since, for example, Apple moved away from Intel with their laptops and the somewhat highly anticipated upcoming ARM windows (Snapdragon Elite X chips) + Microsoft obviously working on their ARM based Windows variant

All smartphones use ARM as well and tons of others consumer electronics like smart watches, TVs etc.

It feels like their potential for growth seems a little limited considering how widely used they already are but maybe they have a lot of potential when it comes to monetizing better.

Maybe someone has some interesting insights about this company that they could share!

Not true. ARM creates Instruction Set Architectures, including reference designs for the cores that implement those ISAs. Yes they do not produce full processors, but they don't need to. Many companies, such as Mediatek and Allwinner, license ARM cores in their processor designs.

However they also give out Architectural Licenses to companies that want to implement ARM ISAs from the ground up in their own core designs. Apple and Samsung are the most famous examples of users of this license.

> ARM instruction set is not even good anymore, its opensource alternative, RISC-V, is well designed and popular. ARMs main competition, MIPS, has gone opensource.

While there is industry interest and effort in making RISC-V gain traction, it is hardly ""popular"" in mass production commercial applications. The bulk of the RISC low and ultra low power chips manufactured today are based on ARM architecture.

It is entirely possible that in a decade or so RISC-V will have 50% market share, but there's still a lot more work to be done on that front."

This beat suggests robust financial health and operational efficiency. Year-over-year growth with earnings rising 32% and sales increasing 14% further bolsters the case for a bullish outlook.

Tesla when it came out with the Model-S and was talking about selling solar roofs and what not was an easy example of growth: Talking about goods and services they will be selling in the future with an implication of how much they will make in the future.

Growth and value is not mutually exclusive.  Apple is a company that year after year has had stable and decent profits, making it a value company.  Apple from time to time comes out with new products that revolutionize a market like the iPhone, the Vision Pro, and other sorts of items, which are growth.  Apple is both a value and a growth company.

The market is efficient, and most news about the present and future is factored into the price almost immediately. The times when innefciencies usually exist is during uncertainty. In uncertain times,  future information is in limbo, and investors tend to react negatively to the news. wich typically drags the price of a stock down and creates temporary undervaluation. The undervsluation could be warranted, or it might just be an overreaction to capitalize on. 

The other time undervaluations exists is due to the difficulty of making accurate future predictions about a company. The larger the growth variance, the more inaccurate the prediction. But always remember growth and value are two sides of the same coin.

I'd read some Peter lynch books as a beginning to merge the ideas of growth and value together. It is the riskier side of value investing. But, even Warren Buffet recognizes that value and growth are related.

Remember, the DCF valuation model is based on growth, earnings, and the discount rate used. This means growth plays a crucial role in valuations."

Think of it as high earnings/cashflow predictability and low earnings/cashflow predictability.

 Take a look at PepsiCo, I'd argue that investing in PepsiCo today isn't value investing because the growth is too low to justify its current valuation. However, its earnings are highly predictable. If for an immaterial reason the value of PepsiCo contracts, perhaps a macro event, or Wallstreet investing elsewhere, then it may easily become a value investing opportunity when purchased at the right price. 

Now, take a look at Microsoft/Apple. I'd argue that many times in the last 10 years, these have been value picks (perhaps less so today). High multiples for a good while, but justified by reasonable growth and reasonable short-term (10 years) earnings predictability.

Now look at Nvidia, very rapid growth, very high multiples, very low earnings predictability. I have no clue what Nvidia's cash flows will be in 4 years. How can I estimate the company's value when I can't reasonably estimate their cash flows. Are they going to double this year like they did last year? Are they going to double again in 2025? Is the AI push going to drive sales in perpetuity, or will there be enterprise upgrade cycles? I have no idea, and even industry veterans should be cautious when companies grow this quickly.

Look at Spotify, lots of topline growth, bottomline inches towards profitability, and a market dominating product. How can we, with reasonable accuracy, estimate margins and cash flows for a company that has never turned a profit. In 5 years, will their operating margin be closer to 15% or 0%. We've never seen them earn a profit, so predicting how profitable they can be is very difficult.

Now look at Ford, a PE of ~5.7. But compare their operating cash flow growth today vs. 10 years ago, then look at how much of their cash flow from all sources they have reinvested in the company over the last 10 years. You'll find that they need to reinvest nearly all of their cash flow just to run in place. Not value, and unlikely to become a value pick."

Value investors are mainly with the mindset to buy below intrinsic value and sell once it reaches fair value or overvalued territory. Mainly backward looking analysis. More applicable to secular/boring industries. More emphasis on ROE than growth and risk minimisation > maximise returns

On the other hand growth investing is with the future looking mindset. They might buy overvalued companies at the present time but expect the companies intrinsic value to be several times more in the future than the price they pay today. Mainly future looking analysis. More applicable to high growth- hot sectors. More emphasis laid on growth than ROE and would take higher risk to maximise returns. Growth > ROE, return maximization > risk minimisation

Growth is not a guarantee, so it's technically requires you to understand the industry well to make hypothesis on technical moat, network effect etc. Value investing from Ben Graham was originally ""cigar butt"" investing which meant finding old companies whose book value was higher than the current market cap of the company. Berkshire Hathway was originally a failing textile company in Massachusetts when Buffet bought it. 

""Value investing"" is kind of hand in hand with Buffets ascension, as before him it was relatively small. As such the interest in value investing has expanded as people like Munger or Monesh Pabrai entered the field. These guys were more ideas driven and companies like Berk started buying companies like Apple, which acts as both a value and growth stock. So there is a venn diagram of companies that satisfy both requirements. 

But to give a clear cut example - NVDA or AMZN only appeal to growth investors. Their P/E multiples quite literally never fall low enough for someone like Buffet to invest as their price is only justified by constant growth. A company like Pepsi on the other hand, is way pass growth phase. Microsoft is probably your best example of a sweet spot. 

How well each category does is pretty sensitive to interest rates, the economy, and market sentiment. If a recession hits, value stocks will outperform growth stocks. In low interest boom time, such as the last decade and a half, growth stocks will beat out value.

Yellen's complaints about Chinese abundance is one of the most anti-human climate terrorist (O&G) protection evils belying US aims to destroy a world it cannot coerce.

It is US policy and big 2 mismanagement that can destroy US vehicle production.  Republican Fed chairman who Trump has threatened to fire if he prevents a recession, US fossil fuel and wars/control over fossil fuels, and diminishing world and China may prevent US adoption of Chinese supply chains, the most important of which is batteries.  Global competitors are less likely to follow self destructive policy.

For ""World""  Global brands can indeed remain competitive by using Chinese parts, Chinese gigapresses, and Chinese robotics.  Not clear how much the US will be part of this, but the usual political optics of disemployment, subsidies, but under the radar parts supply shifting usually accompanies Oligarchy servicing while simultaneously complaining and deflecting blame on reasons for more military spending.

In the end, Chinese dominating EVs and therefore cars, through the supply chain, including the domestic badge stamped on the hood is still dominating EVs.  US handicapping charging and V2G is the path to ensure wars over oil, and ICE dependence, continue."

Yes, the minimalistic approach is a taste, and personally not oneI like, but god damn they drive well compared to their competitors. The efficiency is also on another level, where other brands don't even come close. And why does Tesla make 10k per car sold while European car brands over here lose 10k per ev sold, while the Tesla costs less? Top class engineering, that's why. I have almost 15 years of engineering experience in the automotive industry, mainly focused on the production process, and what Tesla has done is where car manufacturers dream of.

That's not just wrong, you can easily check it here:

The model 3 is by far the most efficient ev on the market right now. And that with a more powerful engine than most competitors. 

I have multiple people in my group who own a model 3 since 2019 with 100k+ miles and nobody had any serious repairs or maintenance done. The only thing that's a known weak point of these models are the wishbones, which cost a few hundred to replace. Almost all big car maintenance agencies here in the Netherlands say the model 3 is a very good car with low maintenance.

Catalyst: high-level discussions with various U.S. government agencies and other offices who provide support for critical mineral projects, domestically and abroad.

Low WACC: currently engaged in high-level discussions with numerous U.S. government agencies and other offices who provide financial support for critical mineral projects within the U.S. and internationally, which may include grants, low-interest debt, non- or limited-recourse debt, loan guarantees, and other support vehicles.

Comparative Advantages:

Reddit’s value is in how we interact with each other and in the implicit context, including social cues and cultural references. Twitter is too short and filled with bots. Facebook is closed and not conducive to longer form factors. Reddit is as close as you get to recording people sitting down and having conversations.

It’s reasonable to imagine GOOGL or MSFT wanting to acquire RDDT and then building the product specifically to generate the kind of data it wants. It would be way more valuable in this way and ads could be removed.

An IPO is a nice way to get everyone an exit, and that would put it immediately on the auction block for any large AI company, considering their market caps are way higher than the market perceives RDDT’s current business model.

Nike Reverses Course as Innovation Stalls and Rivals Gain Ground  
Shoe giant stumbled as CEO John Donahoe pulled away from retailers and relied on old hits. Now it says it’s refocusing on cutting-edge footwear for athletes.

By Inti Pacheco  
April 21, 2024 9:00 pm ET

In late February, Nike NKE -1.26%decrease; red down pointing triangle boss John Donahoe led a virtual all-hands meeting where he delivered a message to his staff: The company wasn’t performing at its best and he held himself accountable.  
  
Two weeks earlier, Nike had announced it would lay off more than 1,600 employees.  
  
Now, as the CEO spoke at the meeting, critical comments started to fill the chat window on the Zoom call while more than 20,000 employees watched.   
  
“Accountability: I do not think that word means what you think it means,” an employee wrote. “If this is cost cutting, how about a CEO salary cut?” another wrote. Soon a cascade of laughing emojis filled the screen.

Quotes:

Since the pandemic, Nike has lost ground in its critical running category while it focused on pumping out old hits and preparing for an e-commerce revolution that never came. The moves, current and former employees say, have eroded a culture of innovation and edginess that made Nike one of the world’s best-known brands.

. . . 

Among the reversals: As Covid raged and more shopping moved online, Nike cut ties with longtime retail partners such as DSW and Urban Outfitters and tried selling more merchandise directly to consumers. It is now asking some of those stores for help clearing out its overstuffed shelves and warehouses.

. . .

The strategic missteps have animated a debate inside the company about its identity. In its zeal to boost digital sales, some current and former employees say, Nike veered from its roots as a maker of cutting-edge footwear for serious athletes. It has opened itself to competition from newcomers such as On and Hoka, which have borrowed from the playbook that fueled Nike’s rise—including focusing on sport over lifestyle, and taking risks on innovation.  
  
Nike’s once torrid growth has stalled. Sales for the quarter ended Feb. 29 were flat compared with a year earlier, and shares in the company have declined 24% over the past year, compared with a 19% gain in the S&P 500.  

. . . 

One of the casualties of Donahoe’s 2020 transformation was a multibillion-dollar operation dedicated to developing footwear sold for under $100. The company deprioritized more-affordable footwear that usually sold to the sales partners that Nike was leaving behind. The move left Nike skewed toward higher-priced shoes.  
  
The first evidence of cracks in Nike’s new approach appeared early last year when Foot Locker Chief Executive Mary Dillon said during an earnings call the brand had reversed course and was sending the retailer a wider assortment of Nike products. By the summer, Macy’s and DSW were saying the same thing.

. . . .

Often quoting Knight, the Nike co-founder, former employees said the principle always was to first capture the market for hard-core athletes with innovative performance gear, and the casual consumer would follow.  
  
In early February, Hoka owner Deckers Outdoor tapped Nike alums to take over both the parent company and the shoe brand. Hoka had $1.4 billion in sales for the year through March 2023, compared with about $352 million three years earlier.  

. . .

Current and former Nike executives believe the future of the company is in its app ecosystem, like the Nike Training and Running Club or its SNKRS app, and the data it can harness from them to help design and sell products. Inside the company, leaders have long tried to draw comparisons to Apple when talking about Nike’s innovation and design culture.

. . .

As part of its accelerated focus on digital sales, Nike hired about 3,500 people to join what the company calls its global technology group, which includes consumer insights and data analytics. Executives at the time said they were investing in “demand sensing,” “insight gathering” and a new inventory system.   
  
Former Nike employees with knowledge of the consumer insights strategy said executives misinterpreted the data in ways that overestimated demand for retro franchises. 

. . . 

At the Olympics preview event this month, the company took over the historic Palais Brongniart in central Paris with a three-day event to unveil its new Air line. Guests wandered through a museum-like, conveyor-belt installation highlighting Nike’s product evolutions and research and development programs. Athletes including runners Sha’Carri Richardson and Eliud Kipchoge modeled the new gear. Retired tennis great Serena Williams narrated the company’s lavish introduction video before appearing on stage.   
  
Outside, 30-foot orange statues of Nike-sponsored athletes including LeBron James, Kylian Mbappé and Victor Wembanyama stood guard.

How often do you have to be right in order to beat the sp500? 

Say you're right 60% of the time with your 5% sl/tp and you make an equal sized bet on every quarterly report on every company that shows a buy/sell signal. You win 60% of the time, lose 40% of the time, net result is you win 20% of the time and in each bet you won you earned a 5% profit. So overall you gained (20% of your bets won) \* (5% profit per win) = 1% profit for your entire portfolio for that quarter. Compounding over four quarters per year you get around 4.1%, which isn't amazing especially considering this is a high turnover strategy.

You can fiddle around with the 60% number and the 5% SL/TP sizing, but what you'll find out is that either the insider trading signal has to be really really accurate or you have to take very big SL/TP bets (higher volatility) in order to beat the market on average."

But in value investing we try to hold for as long as possible, so in the end the turbulence around an earnings report is likely only going to benefit you a small amount relative to the total return over 10+ years. Using insider purchases to determine WHAT to buy can be disastrous because it might not be a quality business that can last 10+ years. There's also the risk that the insider purchases you're seeing reported are reported as part of a stock-based compensation program that runs on a fixed schedule and has nothing to do with the individual making a decision to buy."

Sure, the odds that the company will do well are higher, but so will be the price. Since that study came out everyone knows the relationship between insider transactions and performance.

1. Drugs - They have a lot of drugs coming off patent and are going to have to replace them with ones in their pipeline.

2. Acquisitions - They made several big acquisitions with the Covid cash to address the drugs coming off patent. Those acquisitions used up pretty much all the Covid cash and almost doubled their long term debt load. If they get some drugs approved from those acquisitions they'll be in a better place moving forward, if not they're in trouble.

3. Costs - Looking at their numbers you would expect the revenue from Covid to come down, but what is concerning is that their costs have not come down at all. Those elevated costs and decreased revenue numbers are destroying their margins.

4. Capital Management (my concern) - They had plenty of cash from Covid, but used all of it on big, maybe overpriced, acquisitions. Not one penny went to capital returns for shareholders. Fully diluted share count is exactly the same as it was two years ago, and the dividend was increased by a miniscule amount. I would've liked to see them reward shareholders a little bit more.

I hope you are doing great. I am reaching out to get know about your thoughts in regards to Tesla and their current valuations at 142 USD. Where do you believe they are heading to? Is their future plan and goals still reasonable and achievable? 

  
Here is an overview:

Tesla, Inc. is a prominent company in the automobile industry, known for designing, developing, and selling electric vehicles, as well as energy generation and storage systems. The company operates in two main segments: Automotive and Energy Generation and Storage.

In terms of financials, Tesla has shown impressive growth with a Market Cap of $468.96B and Total Revenues of $96.77B. The breakdown of Tesla's revenue shows that the majority comes from Automotive Sales Revenue, accounting for 81.13% of total revenue.

This indicates the significance of Tesla's electric vehicle sales in driving its overall revenue. Additionally, the company has been profitable, with positive Gross Profit Margins and Net Profit Margins.

Tesla's revenue has been growing steadily, with a 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 39.12% and a 5-year CAGR of 33.77%. The company's revenue growth is supported by its strong performance in Automotive Sales Revenue, which has seen consistent growth over the years.

Overall, Tesla's financial data reflects a company with a strong market presence, innovative products, and a focus on sustainable energy solutions.","['an', 'are', 'TSLA', 'well', 'has', 'do', 'Net', 'you', 'out', 'am', 'two', 'all', 'for', 'main', 'by', 'hope', 'on']",,

1253,National World - Looks Like a Potential Value Play Within UK Small Caps,2024-04-21 18:46:22,82.0,"I’ve been looking at National World, a news publisher, in conjunction with Reach, its closest peer on the UK exchanges. For those unfamiliar, National World is a relatively new venture from 2019, acquiring a portfolio of local titles and effectively digitising and making the operations more efficient. By contrast, Reach was formerly the Trinity Mirror group and owns a number of national titles alongside some local publications.

Currently, National World has a market cap of c. £35m, P/E of 13.52 and a dividend yield of 4.05% compared to Reach with a market cap of c. £215m, P/E of 9.66 and dividend yield of 10.65%. Reach in particular is priced a bit like a cigar butt stock with good reason, physical newspapers are in structural decline. There is also increasingly more competition for digital media and seemingly relative low barriers to entry with anyone able to set up a blog or YouTube channel.

I would firstly argue that the rate of decline of the industry may be anticipated to be too fast. For example, there is still a significant portion of the population (the 40-50+ age brackets) who read newspapers and this often forms part of their routine. Additionally, local news remains highly relevant in some areas eg. following local sports teams. These established publications also have a credibility established that makes it harder for new entrants to disrupt their market share whilst they establish their own credibility and reputations.

With this in mind, a P/E of 10 does not seem undemanding for a company in the sector, as Reach is currently priced at.

Revenue is stable at National World from FY21 to FY23 in the region of £84-88m compared to Reach which is down from £616m in FY21 to £569m in FY23. Digital revenue is also increasing as part of the revenue mix at National World, growing from 14% in FY21 to 21% in FY23. Reach has actually decreased its portion of digital revenue from 24% to 22% in the same period. There would appear to be more scope for the local publication assets held by National World to be developed digitally moving forwards.

Despite being a smaller company with lower quality news titles, I would argue that National World is the lower risk venture. At December 2023, National World held net cash of c. £11m and had tangible assets of £10.5m. By contrast, Reach has net debt of £10m (down from £66m net cash in December 2021) and negative tangible assets of close to £240m. Finally, the other issue with Reach is that it operates a cash hungry defined benefit pension scheme. It has made significant payments of £55-65m in the past three years and there is still a liability of c. £170m on the balance sheet. This is creating a large drag on cash flow and is well above the accounting profits made each year. National World solely operates defined contribution pension schemes meaning this is not an issue for it.

Overall, National World made a profit after tax of c. £2.7m in FY23. There are expected to be cost efficiencies of up to £6m moving forwards alongside £10-15m in revenue growth from acquired entities which should generate c. £1m in profit (assuming a 10% margin). £3.6m was spent on restructuring but this could be viewed as a recurring cost based on the acquisitive nature of the company.

With this in mind, profit after tax is likely to be in the region of c. £10m for FY24. Clearly there is scope for this to increase further depending on if acquisition costs come in lower than FY23. Even with a reduced P/E of 10 in line with that of Reach, this gives a market cap of £100m. Additionally, there is a high margin of safety as the full market cap will be covered by earnings in 3 years when factoring in the current tangible asset position.

There are a few qualitative aspects that I also like for the industry and specifically National World. 

Firstly, the general economic malaise triggered by high inflation, cost of living issues and rising interest rates has squeezed marketing budgets. Therefore, this presents an attractive point in the cycle to invest as once economic conditions improve, this discretionary marketing will increase and this should flow through to earnings from advertisements. 

Secondly, it is unclear what the value of any internally generated intangibles could be relating to archive news and photography. This is unlikely to be material but could provide a boost down the line if certain archived stories or photographs see a resurgence in interest. 

Finally, National World’s chairman has a strong track record in the industry. In 2018, he sold a similar prior venture, Local World, to Reach for £220m showing that he can successfully operate this business model.

Overall, I am close to starting a position in National World but DYOR. I am particularly interested to hear the bear cases here.

|15.51%|10.84%|5.16%|-2.49%|-21.63%|34.15%|6.71%|

* Management has guided that this year, earnings will be around $16.38, this is quite a drop from 2023 earnings of $20.
* Let's base the long term earnings growth of HUM at the GDP growth rate  of 3%, instead of the consensus growth of 6.71% above. This worst case scenario puts the value of HUM at ($16.38 / (9% - 3%) ) or $273 a share. The last price of HUM is $328.33. To me, this means that in the  worst case scenario, Humana could fall another 16.8%  to this floor price of $273.
* Note: i use 9% as the discount for large stable companies. (it is probably lower but i want to be consistent across different companies of similar size).
* If I want to be slightly less pessimistic, i could use 5% long term earnings growth, this works out to around $400. ( 16.38 / (9% - 5%)). Which is above the last price of HUM.
* So, it comes down to this: Are you confident that HUM can grow earnings by 5% in the long term? I would say there is a very high chance that the current problems are temporary and the future earnings growth will be higher than 5% in the long term.
* If you buy at the current price, the potential share price appreciation based on 5% earnings growth is 21%. (ie. $400) . Of course i would buy and hold for the long term.

Oh and yes, Humana has been increasing Dividends annually by 12% and together with share buybacks the annual total yield has been around 2 - 4% a year. I would consider it a red flag if they  suspend their dividends.

Humana is reporting earnings on on Wednesday before market opens.

“The math now works for a CI+HUM fusion,” Windley wrote, adding that a deal for about $420 per Humana share is possible. Humana’s stock was down 0.9% on Monday to close at roughly $325, while Cigna edged up 0.2% to around $353.

Windley said an acquisition could contribute to Cigna’s growth as long as it doesn’t pay more than $470 per share and Humana reaches earnings of $23 per share in 2027.

I think increased utilization is a factor but bigger than that is that HUM underpriced their policies. IE they are offering too much benefits on their policies vs the competition. They aggressively repriced plans in 22 and 23.

I also fear they have attracted a generally higher utilization client than their competitors due to certain benefit offerings.

- Poor stock buyback track record

shitty momentum

otherwise it's a gem, unless you uh, read what's going on with the company lol

but personally i would wait a while before buying it

could be 2 weeks, could be six months

it's tanked 19% in three months so, its good to buy it, but it could go lower, or stagnate for months... so 55% of my gut says wait

&nbsp;

Edit:

I probably read more 'historical' than 'current' news. You can gather a lot about past achievements, their pacing, public opinion, and then-current plans and expectations from reading 'old' news articles about companies you are considering for investment. There are some who would say this effort is doomed fruitless because that information is already incorporated into the stock's current price. Those people are wrong because they consider all knowledge 'information', whereas some knowledge is interpretive or explanatory. That sort of knowledge cannot be mechanically 'priced in'. Some will interpret or explain the available facts in one way, and others will do so differently or opposite. A 'net' view will prevail in the stock's going price. Those who hold a view that is different or opposite to this prevailing view and are right about this stand to gain from the eventual disproof of the prevailing view.

No improvement in speed, search, eyeballs, intellect, training, computation, or whatever other commodity resource will eliminate this enduring source of potential edge. It is possible that general artificial intelligence will come to develop a nuanced and largely correct understanding of business and investment. If so, I may prove wrong. Otherwise, so long as it is flawed and emotional human beings calling the shots, you may gain some advantage by better honing your analytical or interpretive skills as well as your self-control."

1294,MSCI: The best company you've never heard of (Qualitative Analysis),2024-04-21 19:34:34,91.0,"Morgan Stanley Capital International (NYSE: $MSCI) is an indexing company that provides asset owners to benchmarket their investment funds. They construct a broad range of equity indexes based on market cap, factors, or custom indexes. They also offer ESG & Climate indexes and provide analytics + business solutions. Many ETF providers could theoretically offer their own index but they'd prefer to use a strong brand such as MSCI. As a result, this creates an inherent stickiness for their product. As such, MSCI generates the majority (92%) through recurring revenue via subscription and asset based fees.

Financial Statement analysis of the past 5 years:

Income Statement:

Revenues have grown at a CAGR of 10.2% from 1,557M to 2,528M. This is both organic and inorganic growth (See Balance Sheet)

Operating Margin:

EBIT has expanded from 48.5% to 54.8%

Net margin/NI:

Net Income Margin has expanded from 36.2% to 45.4%. Net income has grown from 563M to 1,148M at a CAGR of 15.3%

Balance Sheet:

MSCI is heavily leveraged, with 457M in cash to 4,496M in long term debt. In addition, we can see that goodwill has expanded from 1,562M to 2,887M, demonstrating heavy M&A to increase revenues.

Debt Analysis:

Looking at MSCI's 10-K, we can see that MSCI took on significant debt during a low rates environment to funnel towards share repurchases.

Their debt terms are as follows:

4.00% due 2029 (1,000M), 3.625% due 2030 (900M), 3.875% due 2031 (due 1,000M), 3.625% due 2031 (due 600M), 3.250% due 2033 (due 700M) and rotating facility at the SOFR variable rate + 150-200 bp due in 2027 (due 339M). In summary, these debt terms are extremely favorable and excellent (other than the credit facility of course).

Shares Outstanding:

Shares outstanding have decreased from 84.81M to 79.09 at a -1.38% CAGR.

Free Cash Flow:

FCF has grown from 680M to 1,213M at a rate of 12.27%. Note that FCF is extremely close to NI, representing minimal CapEx, minimal D&A, and minimal SBC (essentially minimal non cash expenses).

To summarize, MSCI is an amazing business growing with consistent revenue, strong and expanding margins, and a healthy balance sheet. Their revenue model is recurring, requires little reinvestment, and is extremely profitable. While the debt could be concerning to some, the notes are due well in the future and are of no concern in the immediate future. Management has shown they're eager to reward shareholders by buying back shares consistently and using some money towards M&A. They have also laid out a long term vision where EBIT will slowly approach 50%+ margins while maintaining low teens revenue growth which is very exciting.

Valuation: Providing a DCF/Multiple/Dividend Discount valuation in my opinion is pointless. Everyone will have different opinions regarding their growth rates, margins, discount rates, etc. That being said, I will acknowledge that napkin math shows that MSCI should underperform the market as it trades at a premium towards their intrinsic value if you assume the business to grow at 10% for the next 5 years. I believe that it will outperform the market as it continues to increase their revenues and expand their margins.","['an', 'back', 'are', 'cash', 'next', 'MSCI', 'well', 'Note', 'FCF', 'you', 'be', 'low', 'for', 'by', 'or', 'on', 'both', 'see', 'math', 'Cash', 'Free', 'grow', 'See', 'bp', 'has', 'it', 'can', 'out', 'via', 'best', 'NI', 'DCF', 'Net', 'very']",,

You'll get growth and some of those Fair Values definately 'readjusting' every 90 days though....

i think the estimated values though mean less and less with the lower quality of the company, so like don't even consider a GF Value to ever be achieved with something like General Electric... for uh, quite a while.

I think MSCI is going to have a good year...

and man what a massive drop this morning!

I was shocked when my limit order went through with the drop today

The last two things i bought with a massive crash was Globe Life, which Buffett dumped after bad news stories, and MSCI.

GL was something else, i looked at the winners and losers of the S&P 500 a week or two ago...

i said that's Buffett's pick that he sold, man it's crashed 15%  
i checked out the fundamentals and it didn't change much from my old notes, and i said, should i buy it?

they froze it on and off during the day, i didn't think you could even buy it, but it dropped 50% and then 60%.

..........

I think Gurufocus does a much more cautious thing with any of the analysts, look at something like Simply Wall Street, and it feels like a roll of the dice, with what they think all the good things, and even the bad things.

I think i told someone, only look at Simply Wall Street for the bad stuff they have to say about a stock... but even then, i wonder if they are the more random version of seeking alpha.

.......

I wouldn't always go with the DCF, you get some of these famous valuation authors say some pretty fruity stuff about NVidia, and well, i think they're good at looking at company fundamentals, but i'm not sure they're good stock pickers.

I think you look at undervaluation or overvaluation, and stop speculating too much on growth and if they can maintain it."

Considering so much of assets are in intangibles and goodwill, it’s clear why the denominator or invested capital is high, but why aren’t these intangibles generating better returns and cash flow growth? Is it because they simply overpaid for mediocre opportunities?

Also, why is their inventory turnover slowing? This has caused their cash conversion cycle to uptick. 

The low ROIC and what I suspect to be low returns generated from intangibles is the biggest red flag I see with this. Consistently low ROIC and returns against assets and equity does not give me hope of a multi bagger opportunity. Hoping you can shed light on this."

High free cash flow yield, but variable.",2024-04-21 03:54:14,94.0,"Greif is a packaging company that makes steel and plastic packaging containers globally as well as paper packaging in the United States. Both of those sectors, particularly the US-based paper one, have suffered in terms of pricing and volume in recent years, although my impression is that the sector is seeing signs of a bottoming out of these trends. The company's market cap is $3 billion, and I calculate its free cash flow to equity in 2023 as roughly $372 million, as compared to $519 million in 2022 and $390 million in 2021.

However, its first quarter 2024 results were disturbing, producing a free cash flow yield of $42 million as compared to $68 million in the previous quarter, against a 4% year over year decline in sales. I am wary of placing too great an emphasis on the results of a single quarter, but I wonder if even this apparently attractive free cash flow yield is sufficient compensation for a company with such broad swings in sales and income, especially as packaging is said to be a pro-cyclical industry.

1333,Asia File – handling digital disruption,2024-04-21 02:44:38,95.0,"We have read stories about how some of the Malaysian media groups “suddenly” have to close down their newspaper operations due digital disruption. Digital disruption does not happen overnight and you would have thought that companies would have years to prepare for this.



One good example of a company that took step to anticipate digital disruption is Asia File. This is a global filing company. We all know that digital technology is changing the way we store documents and the demand for files will continue to decline.



Asia File recognized this and for the past decade, it had stopped expanding its filing business. Instead it diversified into food and consumer wares about 7 years ago. This have given it a possible non-stationery growth path. But it is not clear whether this can be as big as the stationery business. So the company is still looking for other ventures.



This good story is that its stationery business is a cash cow and it is still not clear how long it will take for the demand for files to become negligible. In the meantime, the company is using the cash and time to build up replacement businesses. 



I am sure you will not read any story about this company suddenly closing down the filing business due to digital disruption. If you want to know more about this, go to page 21 of INVEST

This is my first post here, I tried to keep it short. Hopefully it will be worth your time and maybe I could get some constructive reflection.

Here I am requesting to all of you to critique my following thesis on one of the business that I recently uploaded on Value Investors Club - Unfortunately, it Got declined (which might be deservedly so) - I am just 1.5 years into value principles/concepts yet, I know there is long runway to cover and learn - I am really interested in Value investing and in general lives of value investors - where investors like Lilu & Mohnish build capital and spend it on society through their charitable activities and live ethical life. 

Not bragging about what I have learned or What I do but just sharing to get feedback on my loopholes (since I don't have any value investor friends) - I have read some of the books by Peter lynch, Adam Sessel, Bruce Greenwald, William Green, Guy Spier, Howard marks, Chris - Listened to almost all the annual meetings from 1994 to 2023 of Berkshire Hathaway, Listened to 100s of videos on value investing (Compounders to cigar butts) - I think I have made some decent % progress in terms of how to behave - After facing rejection from Value investors club and seeing this reality check, I have been feeling horrible, just got to know about Robert Lou as well.

I hope some of you can provide constructive critique (Please do not unnecessarily roast - I know it is Chinese so take that out of the discussion too). Also, I did saw some people recommended that specific words should be used for VIC as posts are analyzed by Hedge fund managers.

I will be thankful to you guys for reading this and providing me any feedback/comments or whatever you feel like I should be improving - Any reading material/ recommendation... anything. Thank you❤️

**~VIC Post:~**

China Automotive Systems, Inc. is a major supplier of power steering components and systems in the Chinese automotive industry. The company mainly operates through eight Sino-foreign joint ventures. Company’s products include four separate series of power steering with an annual production capacity of 8.0 million sets of steering gears, steering hoses, and columns. The main customers of CAAS include China FAW Group, Dongfeng Auto Group, BYD auto company, Beigi Foton Motor, Cherry Automobile co and Stellantis N.V., and Ford Motor company in North America.

Valuation at 5 years low - Record performance in Revenue of Top and Bottom line – Improved Margins - Solid Balance Sheet

Why? (CHEAP – UGLY – OBSCURE – IGNORED).

**Valuation:**

Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) = Current Assets – Total Liabilities = 508 – 358 = $150M

Net Current Asset Value per share = NCAV/Shares outstanding = $150/$30 = Approx. $5.00 NCAV

As of today 4/16/2024, = PE 2.78, Forward PE 5.33, ROE = 11.50%, ROA = 5.20%, ROIC = 8.77%, P/B 0.31, PS 0.18, Debt/EBIT -0.44.

**\*As of 31 December 2023: (Shares outstanding 30.19 million) – Market Cap – Ranging Around $100 Million\***

**Balance Sheet Assets:**

Cash and Cash Equivalent **=** $166.00 Million ($40 Million Pledged)

Total Current Assets = $564.08 Million

Total non-current Assets = $202.37 Million

**Liabilities:**

Current Liabilities = $383.74 Million (A/c Payable - $253 Million & Current Debt $48.21 Million – Justified more than the protection of A/c receivable and Cash on hand).

Long-term Liabilities = $14.28 Million out of which $1.27 Mill long term debt and all others non-current liabilities.

**Income Statement**: As of 31 December, 2023:

Revenue = $576.35 Million (2024 – Guidance $605.00 Million)

Gross Profit = $103.76 Million

EBIT - $43.82 Million - Pretax Income = $42.8M – Net Income = $37.66 M

EPS – $1.25 (Best in last 5 years)

Margins = Gross 18.00% - Profit Margin – 6.53% (Best in last 5 years and expected to improve)

**About Management:**

- 64.73% is owned by Insiders (Chairman holds majority)

- Since 12 April 2022 Management has bought back about a Million shares and spent $5 Million – CFO Mr. Jie Lie stated ""Our stock's market capitalization is well below our combined cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, our working capital, our book value, and the valuations of a number of peer companies focused on multiple financial factors.  The share repurchase commits our strong financial position to support shareholder value.""

- Last year 16 November, Mr. Jie lie bought 6,000 shares - $19,200 – CFO has a trend from 2018 to buy shares when they are oversold and sell when overbought.

- On 3/28/2024 Last month's earning call – CFO stated “Balance sheet has cash which itself is $5.50 per share and Current ratio of 1.5

CAAS has a relatively stable business and attractive value opposite to its main Peers like Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. KNDI (PE ratio 72.67/Bad margins, losing money) ECARX Holdings, Inc. ECX (Horrible Balance sheet, Share delusion).

In my opinion, HEADS I WIN, TAILS I DON’T LOOSE MUCH.

There’s a ton of low multiple chinese stocks, even ones in less cyclical industries, some even trading below cash. Why is this any different?

Basically this reads to me like you want to buy a chinese auto supplier because it’s at a low multiple, and I don’t see any unique insights or perspectives. Buying a stock because it has a low multiple is not a thesis.

I'd point out that on their site it says non-U.S. companies face more scrutiny so the opportunity has to be more attractive to get accepted. 

You have outlined that the company trades cheaply. But there are a lot of cheap Chinese companies currently. With a profit margin of a paltry 6.53%, ROA of only 5% and ROIC of 8.77% (using your numbers) you can find more attractive companies. In other words, for any kind of meaningful growth in earnings the company needs to invest huge amounts of capital - you can get higher returns on your capital elsewhere. 

If your point is that the company is relatively cheap to its peers, you should include more about them beyond just the PE which is noisy. What are their ROE, ROA, ROIC, EV/EBITDA, etc. 

And then there is the question of catalyst. A lot of Chinese companies are out of favor in the market right now. Why will this suddenly defy that trend? From what I have heard, the VIC group likes catalysts other than wait and hope one day the market will recognize the undervaluation."

If a stock is trading at a low multiple on absolute basis or relative to its history that’s fine but what you should really be asking is why it’s trading there and then if you disagree with the reasons and you think a normalized multiple is much higher then that’s more of a thesis.

E.g. xyz cyclical stock trading a low p/e, 6x vs historical 10x, because people think it’s overearning / we are past the cyclical peak and think normalized profits are a lot lower.

First, businesses that are capital intensive in terms of long-term tangible assets will have to replace those assets as they degrade, and have to expand large amounts of cash for new capital assets in order to scale revenue. You depreciate tangible assets at capitalized prices, but you have to replace equipment at higher prices thanks to inflation. That means businesses reliant on large amounts of tangible assets to generate revenue always need cash injections. Another way to see it is that your true earnings will be less than the reported net income.

Goodwill results from procuring businesses in excess of their (usually) tangible asset value, which means that the procured business was earning high returns on its tangible assets.

Somebody is willing to loan them more than the value of their tangible assets. That says something about the company. It says something about future cashflows and their dependability. Credit investors are not risk-lovers by nature. The bondholders aren't nervous for a reason. Running a company on negative equity is a huge vote of confidence by its financiers. Somewhat similarly, running a business sustainably on negative working capital is a great achievement: your customers and suppliers have gone from a net use of capital to a net source of it. Getting paid before you deliver a product or service is a very powerful benefit. Buybacks can result in negative equity situations, and all the better for it. If no equity is required to run and expand a profitable business, the returns on it are technically infinite. Capital-efficiency is not a crime.

Balance sheets do not exist in isolation. You need to look at them in the context of the income and cash flow statements. If a company has $500m in assets and $1b in debt, it might look like a disastrous balance sheet, but if they bring $2b in a year in FCF, that balance sheet is not dangerous in the slightest.

Yeah this is what I was getting at with questioning how good they are. I don't feel they are as good as tangible assets like property or equipment. But nor should they be disregarded entirely. They do have some real value, otherwise they wouldn't be there. What is the correct way to 'adjust' them is the question.

> Balance sheets do not exist in isolation. You need to look at them in the context of the income and cash flow statements. If a company has $500m in assets and $1b in debt, it might look like a disastrous balance sheet, but if they bring $2b in a year in FCF, that balance sheet is not dangerous in the slightest.

I agree, but I don't feel that's really the case with SBUX. They have $5bn in operating income and $25bn in debt. How would you quantify at what point it becomes dangerous?

It isn't only danger, it's also the cost, and likely future increase in cost. An extra 5% on $25bn would be $1.25bn, which is 30% of their net income, so significant. It might not increase that much, but they would feel even lesser increases.

To me, a lot of companies are still running on easy money mode, and at risk if we hit testing conditions. I would rather avoid companies with weak balance sheets unless I see good compensation in the price."

Starbucks doesn't have $25b in debt, they have about $15b, alongside $9b in operating lease liabilities (which are very different to debt debt). They also have $3b in cash. So their net debt is actually about $12b. And they're at more like $6b operating income, so a net debt to EBIT of barely over 2. That isn't dangerous. Their balance sheet is far from a disaster, despite what the headline equity figure might suggest.

Also, a lot of the most valuable brands in the world don't even show up on the balance sheet. Apple's brand is probably worth no less than $1t of their $2.5t market cap. They have in total less than $10b of intangibles on the balance sheet.

I used Nike brand just as an easy example…but technically Nike doesn’t carry their brand on the balance sheet. No internally developed “intangible” is carried on the balance sheet. Only things acquired outside the company are carried as intangibles on the balance sheet.

BlackBerry doesnt make their phone anymore. But if I had a company with my own new smartphone design, i could approach blackberry to license their brand and trademark to use for my phones. Let’s say I paid $100,000,000 for the rights to their brand and trademark on my phones for 10 years. Those rights are carried on my books as an intangible asset. Every year, I would reduce my intangible asset by $10,000,000. 

So yes. TECHNICALLY you are correct that intangibles only have value because of the excess cash flow they can bring (in this case I’m making the bet that using blackberry brand is better than trying to build my own), but I still have to account for that asset on my books.

The carrying value of that intangible is not the present value of anything. It is the actual value I purchased it for, amortized over 10 years as per the agreement."

I think we're agreeing. Intangibles have massive value, and that value is not fairly represented (sometimes overrepresented, sometimes underrepresented) on the balance sheet because the balance sheet is just about M&A.

If BATS buy a company with book value of $10bn for $50bn, the company's assets are brought into their accounts at book value of $10bn, and $40bn of goodwill is created to reflect the difference between market and book price. This supposes BATS paid a fair price, and the target company really is worth $50bn, and so should be recognised as an asset of that value.

In reality, it looks like they misjudged at least one of these deals, and it has subsequently come to light that company is not worth $50bn, but $30bn. In that case, they are obliged to reduce the amount of goodwill on their books 

Intangible assets can also include things like brand names, copyrights, intellectual property.
