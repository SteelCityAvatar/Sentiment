Without the support of banks, most of these alt currencies won't take off.\n\nStablecoin is definitely one of the stronger competitors to come along though.  But Congress messed up...and allowed it to be backed by treasuries, money market funds, and checking deposits...not just reserves.  So stablecoins will be fractionally backed.  There can be a \"bank run\" on them and there will be.  When this happens the media outrage over stablecoin defaults will be a PR disaster.\n\nFor stablecoins to take off...merchants like Walmart will HAVE to discount sales for their stablecoins...I'm not sure they will do that.  Plus because stablecoins can be backed by treasuries...everybody will issue their own stable coin and redeem their competitor's for profit.  It will be chaos.\n\nAs an elder Visa shareholder (since 2008), I've seen countless attempts to dethone Visa.  They all failed.  Visa will eventually fall...but I'm not sure this version of stablecoins will be the one to do it.  A huge problem with alt-currencies is bill-pay and direct deposit.  Until they can compete on those fronts, we're not going to see heavy usage of alt-currencies.  Visa will have their earnings announced on July 22nd...I expect them to beat and for stablecoin to be forgotten as this stock rallies on Q2 earnings/guidance.  But I am concerned for 2026.",

If they can come up with a way to bypass Visa and save 1% in fees (after chargebacks / fraud costs), that's a direct plus to net margins, and at 5% net margin that's a 20% increase in EPS. So there's huge incentive to bypass Visa/MC. Will they be successful? If so, smaller merchants are likely to follow suit. It's probably not an unreasonable drop given the recent run-up and certainly not enough of a dip to get excited for a value play, IMO.",

They are both paying tons of money to Visa / MC who are essentially a duopoly. The government also wants this, because they are getting lobbied harder by every retailer and big bank than Visa / MC, plus competition is just good for business and national security.\n\nIt isn't a matter of the tech not being there - that can be solved. And it's not a matter of consumer adoption - that will also happen once this is pushed by the retailers & banks.\n\nNobody likes the Visa / MC monopoly except those two companies, and the new stablecoin regulations are a step towards curtailing it. I'd be careful paying a premium PE for Visa right now. At a minimum, they may have to cut fees to stay competitive.",

CCs already offer 5% off groceries - what's Walmart going to offer to beat that to incentivize a new payment method? Walmart runs at only 2-3% margins already.\n\nEven if you cross those tech and rewards bridges, now the bill is going to hit someone's bank account immediately instead of deferring it on a credit card, meaning the consumer can't spend more than their bank account, so will be more conscious about spending less - another hit to Walmart revenue. And that's if they can do it at all... 48% of American adults carry a CC balance - they can't accelerate spending by a billing cycle like that.\n\nI just can't see consumers materially switching.

I can ask natural language questions about companies and get decent responses. But I find myself having to ask follow-up questions constantly to get the depth I need.\n\n**Perplexity.ai**: Excellent for research and understanding business context. It's particularly good at pulling in recent news and relating it to financial performance. However, it feels more like a smart search engine than a dedicated financial analysis tool.\n\n**Reporto.co**: This one seems most focused on financial data specifically. Good historical data coverage and can handle complex metrics. But again, I'm constantly having to prompt it for different aspects of the analysis.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nHere's what's driving me crazy - none of these tools provide a comprehensive, systematic analysis framework. Instead, I find myself playing \"20 questions\" with each one:\n\n1. Me: \"How's this company's revenue growth?\"\n2. AI: \"Revenue grew 12% YoY...\"\n3. Me: \"What about profitability trends?\"\n4. AI: \"Gross margin expanded to...\"\n5. Me: \"How does this compare to competitors?\"\n6. AI: \"Compared to industry average...\"\n7. Me: \"Any red flags I should know about?\"\n8. AI: \"Debt levels have increased...\"\n\nAnd on and on. By the time I've extracted all the information I need, I've asked 15-20 questions and spent almost as much time as I would have doing manual analysis.\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\n\nIdeally, I'd love to upload an earnings report or enter a ticker symbol and get a comprehensive analysis based on predefined templates and specific metrics. Something like:\n\n**Financial Health Dashboard:**\n\n* Revenue growth (3/5/10 year trends)\n* Profitability metrics (Gross/Operating/Net margins with historical comparison)\n* Return ratios (ROE, ROA, ROIC with peer benchmarks)\n* Liquidity ratios (Current ratio, Quick ratio, Cash conversion cycle)\n* Leverage metrics (Debt-to-equity, Interest coverage, Free cash flow)\n\nThe dream would be to select from different analysis templates (Growth Stock Analysis, Value Stock Analysis, Dividend Analysis, REIT Analysis, etc.) and have the AI automatically run through the relevant metrics and frameworks for that investment style.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nI'm not a professional analyst - just a serious retail investor trying to be more systematic about my research. I manage a decent-sized portfolio and want to do proper due diligence, but I'm also trying to be realistic about time constraints.\n\n1. **Has anyone found a more efficient AI workflow for earnings analysis?** Maybe there are specific prompting techniques or tool combinations that work better?\n2. **Are there AI tools specifically designed with systematic analysis frameworks?** Something that doesn't require constant user guidance?\n\nI've considered building my own prompts or even using APIs to create a more structured approach, but wanted to check if others have already solved this problem before I go down that rabbit hole\n\nCurious to hear your experiences and any suggestions you might have.",

It means a lot to hear from users who are actually doing serious financial analysis work.\n\nHonestly, we know we're far from perfect. There are still plenty of issues and limitations we're working through. \n\nData accuracy was our starting point, but we're constantly finding edge cases and areas where the analysis could be deeper or more nuanced.\n\n**About analysis templates** \\- you hit on something really important there. We've been thinking a lot about this too. Right now our analysis follows some built-in frameworks, but we're working on making these more customizable. The idea is to let users define their own analysis templates and question sequences, similar to what you mentioned about structured prompting.\n\nIf you're interested in helping shape these features, we'd love to have you in our Slack community. We share updates, get feedback on new features, and honestly just learn a lot from how people are actually using (or trying to use) the tool.Feel free to drop your email here or DM me - I'll send you an invite.",

It\u2019s not just about \"aligning interests\", it\u2019s about showing conviction. When someone from the inside puts real money on the line, especially during rough times, that speaks louder than any earnings call.\n\nRecent example: Plug Power. After the stock tanked over 50% YTD, CFO Paul Middleton bought 650,000 shares at $1.03 in June 2025. Just weeks earlier, he had already grabbed 350,000 shares at $0.72. That\u2019s over 900,000 shares bought on the open market in less than a month.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a guarantee of anything. Insider buying is just one signal, and not a magical green light. But when someone with full access to the internals is betting big at these levels, I can't ignore it. At the very least, it makes me want to dig deeper and recheck the thesis.\n\nDo you factor insider buying into your process? Ever had it lead you to a big win or a trap?\n\nIf anyone\u2019s interested in seeing my thesis on this company and discussing it, feel free to DM me.",

        "text": "I've been seeing a lot of posts about NVIDIA being a potential 10x pick. While I won't crush anyone's dreams, let's be realistic - with NVDA already at $3.53T market cap, getting to $35T seems... ambitious. Unless you bought it way below $1T, the math just doesn't work for most of us.\n\nHere's my hard-learned lesson: I've actually held a couple of 10x winners before, but they weren't life-changing. Why? Because I rode them all the way up... and all the way back down. The key isn't just finding a 10x stock - it's protecting your gains along the way.\n\nThat's why I now take my initial investment off the table while letting profits run. Take my position in Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) - bought around $19 over a decade ago, now sitting at $91. I've already pulled out my initial investment plus some profit, so the rest is running for free. Could I have made more by holding everything? Maybe. But how would I have known it wouldn't crash?\n\nMy 10x strategy focuses on small, quality players in the right sectors - not giants. To me, getting 10x picks is all about looking for good and relatively small players in their respective industries, not the giant players. Yes, giants could grow bigger like what Mag 7 did during their dream run post-COVID, but how often does this happen? There's always a confluence of factors before this could happen.\n\nOn the other hand, small and developing players in the right sector are a different animal. Yes, they're definitely higher risk. However, if you do your homework, the chance of hitting 10x is much higher than waiting for the next crazy Mag 7 run.\n\nTwo sectors I'm particularly excited about right now: Silver - not gold or platinum, but silver. Gold has run up quite a bit, pulling the gold-silver ratio higher. The next phase in my opinion is to go back to the long-term mean of around 50. There's just so much more room to run if this is indeed the case. Furthermore, the growing importance of silver in the new green economy can't be underestimated. Silver will go into deficit before you know it. I'm looking at Sun Silver Ltd and Silvercorp Metals (SVM) - small caps they may be, but we're looking at a long runway with plenty of silver holdings.\n\nDefense is my other focus. I held RTX and just sold out right before it shot up when Israel bombed Iran - classic timing! For 10x potential, I'm holding Kratos (KTOS), a small but growing significant company. I believe, will be the next wave of defense contractors that could deliver 10x growth and more.\n\nThe beauty of small caps is the asymmetric risk-reward. For those trading these opportunities, timing and capital efficiency matter enormously. I've been using tigercba's contra trading feature to capture immediate opportunities when I spot them but don't have settled funds ready - especially useful for these smaller, more volatile positions where timing can make or break the trade.\n\nWhat sectors are you hunting in for your next 10x? And more importantly, what's your exit strategy to actually capture those gains when they come?",

Biotech. **Instant pass**.\n\n> PFE \nPfizer. Big pharma.\n\n$150bn marketcap, $63bn debt, $20bn cash. $60bn revenue, $8bn earnings. Biotech margins that have come down since covid. Revenue and earnings are good but there some weird variations probably due to covid and how biotech pipelines work.  Why is their return on invested capital only 6%? Paying $150bn to get $8bn of earnings doesn't seem good enough either. Anway, it's a biotech so that's a **pass**.\n\n> HNST. The Honest Co. Sells consumer packaged goods directly to consumers. \"Digitally native\".\n\n$480mn marketcap, $22mn debt, $75mn cash. Looks alright. Shareholders are still being diluted last year by 13%. $380mn revenue, -$6mn earnings. Revenue growing 5% a year. Maybe this is an operating leverage story? I thought selling consumer goods over the internet is highly competitive. **pass**.\n\n> RR. Richtech Robotics. Robots that replace service workers in hotels, restaurants, etc.\n\n$214mn marketcap, no debt, $30mn cash. Diluting shareholders by crazy amounts. $4mn revenue burning $8mn a year. Don't need to go on that is a **pass**.\n\n> VITL. Vital Farms. Sells pasture-raised eggs and butter with an \"ethical conscious capitalism\" angle.\n\n$1.6bn marketcap, $20mn debt, $160mn cash. Clean. Shareholders only diluted by option rewards I guess. Great margins for selling eggs and butter. Pasture raised food is quite common in Europe but I guess there is a market niche in the US. People started caring about better quality food? Would need some insight from an American here. Insane 30% yoy growth but you have to pay 30 times earnings. Compounder bros might take a stab at it but that is something you should have bought a year ago. Seems like a great company but it goes onto the **watchlist** for me because price.\n\n> BFLY. Butterfly Network. Handheld ultrasound.\n\nActually a colleague of mine did his PhD designing small portable ultrasound systems but I digress\nAnyway, you know the drill already. No earnings, shit revenue. It's a **instant pass**\n\n> LCTX. Lineage Cell Therapeutics. Biotech treating degenerative diseases.\n\nSee above. **Instant pass**\n\n> MPW. Medical Properties Trust. Company that acquires and develops net-leased healthcare facilities.\n\n Actually, I know this co. It's a deep value asset play that is kind of complicated with bankrupt hostpitals and missed rent that should be paid back (a special case for healthcare facilities apparently). There is some non-trivial amount of debt. This needs a real deep dive. **watchlist**",

        "text": "There are so many reasons why revenue has declined but the main points are\n\n1. Horrid service delivery stemming from the poor merger integration of HPES, CSC, EDS, Luxoft etc....\n\n2. Bad sales org\n\n3. Poor management \n\n4. Divestitures of data centers and businesses (DXC used to own a bank, prison management software etc.) selling these causes lower revenue.\n\nDXC was formed in 2017 by a mega merger of a bunch of companies. Then CEO Michael Lawrie basically decided to cut expenses to the core and try to milk the company for cash. This led to the departure of several large companies which in turn led to lower sales. \n\nLawrie was booted in 2019 and replaced with CEO Salvino. Salvino went on to mostly fix the service delivery problem but there were still structural issues. DXC had a bunch of data centers that were not at full capacity and thus burning cash. They decided to close these data centers and shift customers to the cloud. This in turn caused a sales headwind because the work sitting in the cloud does not flow through DXC's P&L. The trade off is happier customers because AWS and Azure give better service than DXC's zombie cloud strategy. One customer sabre closed 17 data centers 3 of which where owned by DXC and shifted to Google cloud. This alone cause a big headwind. But even Sabre retained DXC for some core legacy IT systems since they're mission critical and DXC/Kyndryl are really the only 2 companies left running these are scale.\n\nFurther issues include Salvino not running a fully functional organization. They had 5 ERP systems (most companies just use 1 from SAP). There where Multiple labor management software for a company with 120k people! (now fixed by new management team)\n\nNo Marketing department and weak sales department.\n\nWhile Salvino was able to stabilize the delivery and renewal rates improved he struggled with winning new work which ultimately led to him being fired and replaced with a 3rd management team.\n\nNow we have Raul who basically came in and restructured the entire sales org. Incentives have been completely reworked and a new chief revenue officer has been hired. DXC also started to build a marketing arm and held its first ever sales kick off events (crazy considering they have 120k employees and never had a SKO. I've seen some positive employee reviews talking about this on Glassdoor.\n\nThey've also made some really interesting hires. The former COO of the CIA and the former COO of the Fed (separate people) now work for DXC. With the aim of winning government work. \n\nDXC security which was always sold as an add-on to other services has also been given a sales force so they can go directly to market themselves.\n\nThe most surprising thing is DXC's traditional IT business is now starting to get attention from management and they've won some large contracts. It had been a drag for years but now The book to bill is above 1.0 so if things go well we should get close to break even revenue next year.\n\nThere's also a new product launch in DXC modern work place and the former Chief Digital Officer of Microsoft is working to try and turn that offering around. This in peticular has a lot of promise since the modern workplace has been declining by greater than 10% for years. Had DXC sold it know of one instance where DXC would've grown sales organically on a YoY basis. \n\nIt appears from both press release and book to bill ratios that this has started to work. So I'm optimistic about DXC's future even in segments that have historically declined.\n\nSetting all that aside there are also parts of DXC that are currently growing just disguised by the rest of the business. \n\nDXC insurance is growing at roughly 5% annually. It's peer verisk does only 2x the revenue of DXC insurance and has nearly a $40 Billion market cap vs $3 Billion for all of DXC.\n\nDXC has an SAP & Service Now business groups which are both growing low double digits %.\n\nThey've also make software for Mercedes, BMW, United Airlines (app). Which is sorta in a cyclical decline but should eventually come back. \n\nNot to mention random things like DXC Hogan which processes $3 Trillion deposits annually and is used by 50% of all U.S banks. \n\nOr DXC's investment in velonetic the insurance processor for Lloyds of London. They process \u00a3110 billion worth of policies annually. (Pretty sure this is an off balance sheet item)\n\nDXC also has a $100 million judgement from Tata currently pending. This is equivalent to roughly 3% of the market cap.\n\nBasically if DXC can do the unthinkable and grow sales like I believe they are capable of then it will probably be a greater than 10x return. If not it's probably dead money for a few years since they generate so much cash and have shown an ability to maintain FCF via closing data centers. But I also acknowledge that this company is not for the faint of heart.",

The customer experience seems to really resonate. Management is solid, insider ownership sits at 14%, and their recent earnings call highlighted improving operating efficiency despite a tough macro environment. Their goal of hitting 1,000 locations by 2032 feels realistic if they keep executing.\n\nThe stock has pulled back after the IPO, but that looks more like a healthy return to fair value than anything fundamentally wrong. If you\u2019re comfortable holding something without checking it daily, CAVA looks like a strong long-term bet with real upside.",

IMO their store expansion artificially spiked after their Zoes Kitchen conversion completed...and now that is complete, their store expansion should slow down.  They just don't have the debt/equity to expand more aggressively.  The are other concerns...they use a lot of ingredients which can be a challenge for restaurants.   Also restaurant stocks like this tend to be overvalued from \"familiarity bias\".  Their short float is high at 10.16%...and I don't think the shorters are wrong.\n\nSince Feb the stock has dived from 130 to 74.  Each of the past two quarterly earnings announcements have hurt the share price.  I suspect the the trend will continue...and on Aug 28th (next Q announcement), we'll see another fall.  My advice would be to wait on the sideline.  The stock should continue to fall and you should be able to get it much cheaper later.\n\nI want them to succeed...but currently the numbers don't add up for a good investment.",

And I think everyone agrees that 45 PE is steep for CMG. \n\nYou could argue that CAVA has a wider TAM as CMG has already grown so much (nearly 10x the locations) but CMG opened over 300 locations last year\u2026 CAVA plans on adding 600 stores over the next 7 years. By comparison this feels like an extremely slow and conservative expansion rate. \n\nAdditionally chipotle is way more efficient on a revenue / profit per location basis - I calculated it at 30% when I ran the numbers at the end of last year. \n\nCAVA has a lot of opportunity, but they are trading as if they are already capitalizing on it, and I just have not seen any evidence to this.",

I also come up with custom stock ideas on my own, and I keep an eye on discussions from Reddit and several newsletters. If you\u2019re interested, I can share my top five newsletters that I read regularly. On top of that, I make it a habit to read 10-Ks all the time.",

My guess is it pulled into a scan, scanned numbers look great, put it through my personal checklist, graded out, but the AMPAC acquisition is what im all about. \n\nIts way outside my area of expertise but ive been pushing myself to be more moat focused because at the end of the day, the moat protects you in any conditions and the lesser the moat the higher the risk. But what i see here is a critical product that you can only get here or in russia india china or maybe north korea...its basically a monopoly. No way we are buying from those guys. \n\nAnd my bet is demand is so great for rockets, missles, space and defense things that this thing is gonna fucking rip and nobody knows when it will stop. With the share count being so low, if any big buyer comes in, this thing can go a long way.\n\nIm seeing consolidation in the chart but I think this is the beginning of a monster run.",

Suncor for its great balance sheet and Enbridge for its good track record, pipeline ownership and future expansion projects.  XOM and CHX are classics...but are a bit pricey and a bit more exposed to any issues with the Straight of Hormuz.\n\nI'm surprised to see several posts mention DVN.  I'm a long term shareholder that has lost half my principal on the company.  Basically this company has had an unhealthy obsession with dividends.  They got greedy and when oil priced tanked in 2008, they crashed hard.  To avoid bankruptcy, they had to sell their prime Alberta oil fields at a discount, they had to issue a lot of stock, and a ton of new debt.  The company for many years has been mismanaged with an overemphasis on distributions and some bad mergers.\n\nBut there is room for optimism...they finally \"retired' their CEO and we have a new person at the helm for 2025.  DVN has focused on paying down its ridicules debt and had made some decent value stock buy backbacks.  Unlike other oil stocks they don't have Mideast exposure...they pretty much focus on the Texas area. The stock has rallied about 12% since June 1st and it has seen a resurgence of interest.\n\nNot sure which way the stock will go.  I'm  hoping the new CEO will finally turn things around this year.  If the Mideast gets really crazy they could spike in value because again they have no mideast oil fields.",

Adjust between these 3 as the individual names cycle in and out of favour based on BS reasons like news stories or quarterly earnings.\n\n  \nLet me know who you end up with and we can compare our picks.\n\n:D",

I get the whole \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d and \u201cgo against the herd\u201d narrative, but let\u2019s be honest: why would anyone buy into a sector that\u2019s been dead money for nearly two decades?\n\nIf you want to make a case for oil outperforming over the next 10\u201320 years, fine \u2014 but make the case. Because just saying \u201ccrisis\u201d or \u201cgeopolitics\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it. We\u2019ve had dozens of oil-related wars since the 1970s, and I can\u2019t think of a single one that led to sustained outperformance in oil equities. Maybe a temporary spike, but then back to chop.\n\nFrankly, out of all major sectors, I struggle to find a worse long-term investment than oil. Even if crude spikes due to crisis, and oil stocks rip for a few months, I still believe gold would outperform \u2014 and actually offer uncorrelated returns with some credible track record since 1971.\n\nOil might offer a 3\u20134% dividend and trade at a low P/E, but in my view that\u2019s a value trap, not a value play. It\u2019s priced dirtcheap because its actually dirt. The sector\u2019s been structurally declining, policy-hostile, ESG-unfriendly, and capital-destructive for years.\n\nSo unless someone can explain why the trend reverses now, I\u2019ll pass. For my portfolio, I\u2019d rather hold gold \u2014 which at least has monetary relevance, long-term store-of-value logic, and a historical basis for outperformance in chaotic regimes. Oil? It\u2019s just dying slowly. Why bet on a comeback that never comes? Oil is like one of those dying memecoins where people got emotionally attached in the 90s and cant let it go, the best case 5% dividend cashflow is imo not near enough to cover the opportunity costs of a msci world etf, i ll stick to retailers/tobacco/finance instead (TGT,DG,CVS,BTI,MO,BLK, MAIN, PEP), some of them are just as old but at least they are not as fossil as oil (literally)",

This idea has been mentioned in the past but a recent acquisition makes this new again. \n\nHistorically, I lean towards consumer brands but in the past year plus Ive gone in a new direction. \n\nMy top holdings are GEV, VRSN. Now onto Newmarket.... \n\nFounded in 1887 with a name and roots you may have heard, it was Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Co. \n\nAfton Chemical and Ethyl Corp have been the main pieces of this business, one making hydraulic lubricants and other stuff (yawn) and the other making gas additives (yawn). These are boring businesses with limited competition in highly regulated areas. I look at these as these as 3.5% growth businesses with gains coming from efficiencies of operation. Lumpy too, cyclical. \n\nBut the whole key to this is a recent acquisition of AMPAC in Q1 2024. *The bet is that AMPAC has an essential monopoly on a critical material and demand is going to completely swamp supply making this highly profitable.* There is a fair chance by the end of 2026 AMPAC is representing 20% of earnings with a 50% operating margin. \n\nWhat does AMPAC make that is so special? Ammonium percholate \n\nWhat ammonium percholate do? Oxidizer in solid rocket motors, and missles. Needed to light the match. \n\nWhere else would I get it if not Newmarket? China, India, Russia. Maybe North Korea. Do you think we are buying from any of these guys? \n\nCould this be disrupted?

And in April of this year approved a 100M plant addition which will increase capacity of ammonium percholate by 50%, to be completed in 2026. They wouldnt be doing this unless there was a clear need.  And my guess is it still wont be enough. With nice ROC, im \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb with this and it attests to my thesis which is ammonium percholate demand is going to greatly outpace supply, it will be high margin, prices will go up, and who knows when demand ends.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nCame across a fascinating case study in market perception vs. business reality and wanted to share my findings and get your thoughts. The company is Academedia (OM:ACAD), the largest independent education provider in Northern Europe.\n\nOn the surface, people may think this is a DONT BUY, that it's a value trap. The stock has been beaten down for a couple of years because of scary headlines about \"regulatory risk\" in its home market of Sweden. The government is making noise about cracking down on profits for private schools, and the market is pricing in a doomsday scenario.\n\nBut when you actually look into it, the story gets interesting.\n\n**The Bull Case in a Nutshell:**\n\n* **Dominant Market Position:** This isn't some small-cap. They are the #1 player in their region with over 110,000 students.\n* **Cash Cow:** The business is gushing cash. We're talking a free cash flow (FCF) yield of over 10% for the current fiscal year. For a stable, mature business, that's wild.\n* **Proven Performer:** This isn't a turnaround story. They've consistently delivered mid-to-high single-digit growth for the past decade. ROE is \\~10%, ROCE is \\~12%.\n* **Smart Management:** The CEO has been there for 20+ years. Instead of just panicking about the Swedish government, they're actively making the company less Swedish. They have a clear goal for 50% of the business to be international and are aggressively expanding into high-demand markets like Germany. International ops already make up 31% of sales.\n* **Hidden Stability:** About 10% of their revenue comes from an adult education segment which is counter-cyclical (it does better when the economy is worse), providing a nice built-in hedge.\n\n**The Bear Case (Why the Market is Scared):**\n\n* **The Big Scary Regulation:** This is the main one. If the Swedish government goes nuclear and bans profits or slashes the voucher system, it will hurt. There's no sugarcoating that.\n* **Dependence on Government:** Their revenue is tied to state-funded vouchers. This means their fate is always somewhat in the hands of politicians.\n* **Intense Competition:** The Swedish education market is a knife fight for student enrollment, both from other private schools and public ones.\n\n**My Take:**\n\nThis feels like a classic case of the market pricing in the absolute worst-case scenario on the regulatory front, while completely ignoring the fundamental strength of the business and management's very clever diversification strategy. The >10% FCF yield provides a huge margin of safety. You're basically getting paid to wait and see if the regulatory fears are overblown.\n\nIf the regulations end up being less severe than feared, or as the international business continues to grow and make up a larger piece of the pie, there could be a significant re-rating of the stock.\n\nI put together a full 36-slide presentation that goes way deeper into the financials, Porter's Five Forces for the industry, competitor analysis (they have some tough rivals), and a full breakdown of the valuation. It's a much more comprehensive look than I can fit here so if anyone is interested they can read the full deep dive in their own time: [https://tscsw.substack.com/p/stock-pitch-6-a-counter-cyclical](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/stock-pitch-6-a-counter-cyclical)",

The biggest dip is late march.  I would hypothesis this is for yearly taxes and filing in front of the April deadline.  If you need to save money to pay your tax bill, you not buying stock.  Less demand equals lower prices.\n\nThe other big dip is early September.  IMO this might be another tax sell.  Employed workers don't have to worry about estimated taxes as it's done automatically...but everybody else has to pay quarterly taxes.  Sept 15 is when Q3 is due...so logically big investors will be need to start banking money and perhaps even selling early September so they are liquid for their estimated tax payment.\n\nJune 16th is when Q2 estimated taxes are due...and you can see a dip here as well.  Lastly  Jan 15 is when Q4 taxes are due.   The graph wraps at that point so it is harder to see, but there is a slight dip that precedes January.  This is more complicated because tax loss harvesting is going on now as well as fund rebalancing.\n\nThoughts how on accurate tax dates are for predicting the SP500?  Might this work better for predicting certain stocks or sectors than others?",

        "text": "A few months back, I gave my preliminary analysis of Nintendo ($NTDOY) with rudimentary knowledge of investments and valuation. I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve learnt alot since then and more information has come out so this is how I value Nintendo know and wondering if anyone can help to question and challenge this analysis to improve on it!\n\nUSD:JPY Rate : 144\nCurrent Price : 13,100 JPY / 21.57 USD (ADR price likely increase once market opens tonight due to 6% increase in Japan markets)\nShares Outstanding : 1,164 Mn\nMarket Cap : 105 Bb USD (13,100 x 1,164 / 144)\nPE Ratio : 55\n\nFY 2025 (ended March 31, 2025) Revenue : 1.2T JPY / 8Bn USD\n\nNintendo gave a FY 26 forecast of 1.9T JPY Revenue which comes to about 13,000 USD. Taking the last 9 quarters, their average net margins (NM) is ard 26% but only 24% as of last quarter. Assuming a conservative NM of 22% and a PE of 40x (higher than historical but lower than current and imo warranted given growth the switch 2 will bring), this would result in earnings of roughly 2.8 Bn net income (NI) and market cap (MC) of 114Bn USD, 8% upside over current market cap. 8% gain in 1 year is good but not amazing. However, I believe Nintendo can provide alot more as the revenue estimates are conservative.\n\nIn their last earnings, Nintendo said they expect to sell roughly 15M switch 2 hardware and 45M switch 2 software. These softwares includes bundled software (like the mario kart + switch bundle at launch) so I thought to revise down to 2.5 games per console instead of 3 which comes to 37.5M. Switch 2 has been selling @500 USD in America while games will likely go for around @70 USD. This means the incremental revenue for switch 2 is around 15M x 500 USD + 37.5M x 70 USD = 10,500 USD. They also forecasted 105M Switch 1 games. Being conservative we can take 100M games x avg price of 40 = 4,000 USD. These already brings us to 14,500 USD not including other income like switch 1 hardware, nintendo online, 3rd party licenses, mobile and IP revenue, merch etc etc so let\u2019s round off revenue to 15,000 USD. With the same NM and PE, the MC is now 132Bn USD, which is a 25% upside after today\u2019s jump. \n\nHope to see what ya\u2019ll think about this analysis and if there\u2019s any holes I\u2019m missing out! One of my biggest uncertainty right now is the future NM, Nintendo forecasted 300 Bn JPY of NI for FY26, which is a NM of 15% vs my estimate of 25%. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t see how their NM would fall so low especially given historical stronger NMs. Additionally, NM was likely under pressure the past 1-2 years due to Switch 2 development, marketing and logistics cost leading to its launch date. I think there\u2019s also potential for higher revenue through levers such as higher switch 2 sales, more games sold per console and greater \u201cother revenue\u201d such as nintendo online and 3rd-party licenses. \n\nSo I\u2019m targeting around 20% - 30% upside on Nintendo, which would be about $26 - $28.",

The two main takeaways from that series for me were the following.\n\nFor one, their IP and fanbase is really unmatched and worth a premium - although the big question is how well can they profit off of it. Mind you, the Pokemon Go app to this day brings in incredible amounts of sales, but very little go to Nintendo as they specifically do not want to have a business model that relies on micro-transactions as they think this delivers poor games. Now on the one hand this goes to show their genuine passion for high quality entertainment, but it also shows you how conservative they are.\n\nMore importantly in my opinion, throughout their entire history they had two segments; handheld and home consoles. When the Gamecube flopped, the Gameboy would help sales stay positive. When the Wii U flopped, they followed up with the Switch. However one big drawback is that they now combined both their handheld with their home console, meaning there's no plan B. Needless to say this combination has worked tremendously well for the past 8 years but they will need to *really* innovate again sometime in the future.\n\nThe thing I struggle with the most in your post is the P/E you attach to it. With the Switch 2 being an upgrade of the original Switch rather than a new console I wonder how well this will sell after enthusiasts are done buying, let alone when the global economic outlook worsens. With Nintendo being a very cyclical company (fun fact, the entire period 2011-2018 has been (next to) unprofitable) I don't see how we would pay 40x earnings for them whilst they're still near record high earnings. Are we expecting as much (sustainable!) growth from them as from companies like Amazon, Apple, Visa and even Nvidia - which all have a lower (forward) PE.\n\nMy personal opinion on Nintendo is that they have perfect the most loyal fanbase in the world, but it's insanely hard to predict what their future cashflows will look like. Where will they be in 10 years? Is it realistic to think they are still on the Switch platform? If so, will it still be popular enough to sell as it does now? If not, will they manage to create a new console that does even better than the Switch? Although I love the company and their background, for me personally it seems like a high risk/low reward at this valuation, let alone at 40x earnings. I really can't imagine them doing 20%+ annual growth for 5+ years which would be the bare minimum for such a multiple.",

They have tried to diversify with movies / merch / theme parks but at the moment that is a small amount of their business.\n\n  \nThey projected to sell 100M+ of the Wii U. They will always get the early adopter for their consoles, however the price of the Switch 2 puts it beyond the younger demographic for a lot of people, also parents buying it for their children. Mario Kart World is (so far) not the killer app that BOTW was.\n\nNintendo are smart and certainly know this, so at some stage they might have to lower the price of the Switch 2, as they did with the 3DS which could affect revenue. Year 2 of console sales is more telling then the first year. Entertainment industry can be fickle and affected by any economic slowdown.",

Ultimately, the risk is that the switch 2 will be a flop and not sell well and I think the past week of sales data says that launch week has surpassed expectations while showing stronger performance than past consoles. Anecdotal experience also says that there is alot of hype and momentum behind the launch despite very vocal backlash regarding the launch (eg price).\n\nAside from this, i think that the problems that plagued those 2 consoles were solved in the switch 2. Firstly, both were home consoles that had to compete w the Xbox and PS series while being weaker technically and, thus, had poor 3rd party support. On the flip side, the switch 2 is a hybrid console boasting specs on par or surpassing the switch 2 and has already shown to have massive 3rd party support. \n\nI\u2019m still expecting higher sales numbers but will be conservative in the actual estimate and revise as more news comes in!",

It's a great game and eventually got the sales it deserved. However BOTW was game changing for Nintendo, it is a masterpiece. Many people bought a Switch just to play it, then bought other games. People are buying a Switch 2 for the console, Mario Kart World is not getting the same reviews or excitement. I expect it will be improved over time. Also Switch 2 is not an innovation as Switch 1 or the Wii was. It's an upgrade like new phone. It's not that different from the Switch 1, other then a bigger screen. This is uncharted territory for Nintendo. I know many Switch owners, they can't see why they would upgrade. Perhaps they are several years away from buying.\n\nNintendo are very, very smart. Year 2 console sales are far more telling after early adopters have bought it. But it's much easier to sell a $300 console to many parents than a $500 console.\n\nNintendo is very vulnerable to console sales. Unlike Sony / Microsoft they don't sell on PC. Microsoft own Minecraft / COD and sell on many platforms. For now Nintendo is flying. Will have to see in the next year.",

Safety net: Redmond\u2019s existing commercial contract guarantees API access and model weights through 2030, so Copilot, Azure OpenAI Service and Windows AI features will keep working even if the equity talks collapse.\n\n2 - Pricing Shock: OpenAI, eager to broaden its enterprise footprint, has quietly introduced double-digit discounts on annual ChatGPT-Enterprise licenses.\n\nThis undercuts Microsoft\u2019s own Copilot-for-Microsoft 365 bundle, where OpenAI inference costs are a big component of Redmond\u2019s gross margin. Customers now have leverage to negotiate lower Copilot prices or buy ChatGPT-Enterprise directly and weld it to existing Office workflows via an API.\n\nAlso, important to note that every 10 % drop in inferred cost recovery could shave an estimated 30\u201340 bps off Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud operating margin this fiscal year, according to Street models.\n\nSupporting Timeline\n\n9:31 AM \u2013 DeItaone\u2002OpenAI starts selling ChatGPT at a discount, hurting Microsoft.  \n9:33 AM \u2013 LiveSquawk\u2002*The Information* reports ChatGPT undercutting Microsoft pricing.  \n9:34 AM \u2013 MarketFlux\u2002\u201cChatGPT Discount Squeezes Microsoft, Shaking Up AI Market Dynamics.\u201d  \n3:51 PM \u2013 DeItaone\u2002*FT*: Microsoft prepared to walk away from OpenAI talks over stake size.  \n3:57 PM \u2013 wallstengine\u2002MSFT could exit if no deal; access to OpenAI tech secured to 2030.  \n4:02 PM \u2013 Investingcom\u2002\u201cMicrosoft may halt OpenAI deal over restructuring disagreements \u2013 FT.\u201d  \n4:07 PM \u2013 PiQSuite\u2002\u201cMicrosoft May Exit OpenAI Talks; partners clash over multibillion-dollar collaboration.\u201d  \n5:26 PM \u2013 *New York Post*\u2002Report: Microsoft willing to abandon \u201chigh-stakes\u201d OpenAI discussions.  \n6:18 PM \u2013 *Wall Street Journal*\u2002New workforce cuts announced as Microsoft pours capital into AI.\n\nDoes Microsoft's future value significantly diminish without having ties with OpenAI? I think they could probably partner with another Large Language Model AI company, This could present an attractive entry point if this sells off due to this.\n\n\\-Articles Sourced From: [Marketflux.io](https://Marketflux.io)",

        "text": "Gray Media (GTN) is the largest operator of local television stations in the United States. The market cap as of 6/17/25 is $420 million. This industry does not appear to be growing; it may be in permanent decline as cord cutting continues. What makes GTN interesting is the valuation. \n\nThe trailing 12-month free cash flow (CFO \u2013 CapEx \u2013 SBC) was $668 million. This gives it a free cash flow yield of 159%. A free cash flow yield this high is unusual, it usually signals a company is serious trouble. \n\nGTN operates on a two-year cycle. They make most of their profits during even year elections. During odd years their profitability is low or negative. Over the last six years they have generated positive free cash flow every year. In quarter 1 of 2025 net income was -$9 million but free cash flow was $110 million\n\nGTN does have a very high debt load their current leverage ratio is 4.92. However, their interest coverage ratio is currently 1.72. That ratio will decline as their earnings go down.  \n\nOverall the company seems to be in a decent position. If cash flow stays the same or declines slowly, they can pay down debt and lower interest costs. During the last full no election year GTN generated $270 million on free cash flow. At today\u2019s price that would be a free cash flow yield of 64%. The worst year since that last big acquisition was 2021. They generated $71 million in Free Cash Flow. That would be 16% free cash flow yield.\n\nThe company is so cheap that I believe one of two things must true. The market is simply pricing the company incorrectly, or there is a huge problem that I am not aware of.",

Despite being heavily over-leveraged in a declining business (Local broadcast TV), I actually still view the company as salvageable if the current management wasn't terrible (part-time CEO Hilton Howell, who pulls a huge pay package despite also being CEO of his wife's family's insurance company).\n\nManagement consistently has shown that they do not care about the common shareholder. There is a huge amount of debt coming due in 2029-2031 that will need to be refinanced at a much higher interest rate. Instead of paying this down, management invested a huge amount into building a production studio \"Assembly Atlanta\" that has been a huge disappointment in terms of cashflow (despite Hilton talking about what a success it is on each earnings call).\n\nIf you feel confident the company won't get wiped out by its 2029-2031 date, you can buy their publicly traded bonds at a 16.8% yield (due 10/15/2030) or 16.00% (due 11/15/2031).\n\nAlso, if you're using cashflow as your metric for this company, it's important to note that during FY2023 the company securitized (sold) its Accounts Receivable to the tune of $300M, which inflates their cashflow metric (they increased the AR securitization by another $100M in F2025).\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the accounting at this company, I'd be happy to answer (as a disgruntled long-time shareholder). Regarding the future of the local broadcast tv business, you could try asking/reading r/Broadcasting.",

I actually bought some in my cigar butt value brokerage account(I keep three accounts to keep things orderly).\n\nOne thing that i think you didnt mention is that this industry is basically captured by two companies.  NExstar and Gray.  They both basically own every single leading local television outlet in every market that matters.  I think in addition to cash flow and earnings, these companies are basically monopolies in their industries\n\nNow, the local television market has definitely shrunk in the past two decades, but I believe that has been largely priced into the shares.  I could see this company doing well for the next 5-10 years especially if interest rates were to come down and they can refinance some of their debt.  That being said, they're already paying down chunks of their debt early to get ahead of that worry.",

        "text": "It is (kind of). Practically it functions similar to a loan, but it is not reported that way in its accounting. \n\nSimplified: Customer owes Gray $310M => Gray sells this to bank for $300M => Customer pays bank $310M. Instead of the $10M difference, actual difference would be SOFR +1%. This is similar to AR Factoring in small businesses (https://www.allianz-trade.com/en_US/insights/accounts-receivable-factoring.html)\n\nHow does this facility affect the accounting? (this is not intuitive)\n\n1. The SOFR +1% doesn't show up in interest expense - it shows up as a Loss on disposal of assets (since AR was sold at a discount)\n\n2. 2023 operating cash flow is temporarily increased by $300M, which shows up in the changes in operating assets of accounts receivable (This is what caused Gray to suddenly decrease AR by $308M in 2023 cashflow statement).\n\n3. At the conclusion of the facility, operating cash flow will then decrease by $300M and the changes in operating assets of accounts receivable will decrease by $300M from the actual (Note: the $300M was extended from 2026 to March 31, 2028 when they sold the extra $100M earlier this year)\n\n4. In financial metrics: This sale of AR causes FCF to increase by $300M in 2023, and would then have decrease FCF by $300M in 2026. If you're trying to find FCF in 2023 as an example of a non-election year, it's probably easiest to use an \"adjusted FCF\" that removes this $300M increase.\n\nEDIT: This is why your Q1 2025 has $109M of FCF - $100M of this came from increasing the Facility to $400M. If you remove the $100M borrowed against AR, Adjusted FCF for Q1 is only $9M. Also, the Rate on the $400M has been increased to SOFR + 1.25% in case you are modelling this.",

        "text": "IMO - I definitely wouldn't give management any credit by saying that they are paying down their debt early. Gray spent ~$450M building a production studio unrelated to their core business (Assembly Atlanta) instead of paying down debt. A lot of that spending was in 2022-2024 (i.e. when the debt overhang was abundantly clear). Despite the project now having a hugely disappointing projected  future cashflow (IIRC ~$25M), CEO has continued to laud it as a great success for the past several earnings calls... I'm definitely not a disgruntled shareholder /s.\n\nAlso, most of the debt paid down with FY2024 cycle's political ad haul was towards the 2027 notes, which likely need to be refinanced soon unless they want to gamble on internal CF from 2026 political cycle. If they were prioritizing paying down debt early, the focus would be towards paying down the 2030/2031 notes at a guaranteed return of 16+%.\n\nNot faulting you for speculating on it based on how it looks on paper, and I expect they will continue to pay out dividends through at least 2027, but IMO Vegas has a better risk/reward at the moment. Also, if you are using FCF in your model - definitely make sure you aren't including the $300M in operating CF from the 2023 AR securitization as an expectation of FCF in a non-political year.",

The atlanta studio is a bid at diversifying their business within a core competency.  They run hundreds of local studios, why not try having a larger media studio for more content?  Also studios are notoriously cash holes until they start cranking out content.  \n\nThese investments are primarily what is weighing down their operating margin along with the debt. I don't fault a company for trying to make strategic investments instead of just using all of their cash flow to pay down debt as quick as they can.  \n\nbut you're right, the crux of my more speculative investment is that it's just too cheap to ignore.  I also believe that political spending is due to increase their earnings given that midterm elections are breaking spend records and they tend to be more locally based. \n\nThe debt picture is for sure concerning, but im not sure if it's totally left for dead yet...",

Majority of payments were towards the 2027 notes, these are not early payments if Gray is intending to primarily use FCF/AR Facility to take care of 2027 notes (earliest maturity).\n\n**Assembly Atlanta is a real estate play.** Gray's idea isn't to produce content there and centralcast it (ask Allen Media how well that idea worked with the Weather Channel replacing local weather staff). NBCUniversal is the one managing all the facilities at Assembly Atlanta (Because this isn't Gray's core competency and its a non-core asset). Gray bought the land, hired a developer, financed the construction, and is leasing the space to different studios for television and film production.\n\nA reasonable person could ask, but why would Gray's management decide to borrow at high interest rates to enter the real estate business when they are focused on video production? It's not like management calculates their performance bonus based on EBITDA, right /s? \n\nBest of luck, shares could still pop as a short-term play if/when the FCC deregulates. The company shouldn't be left for dead either way - most likely when refinancing the 2030/2031 debt maturities the common equity will be heavily diluted or wiped out (but reorganized company survives).",

Unfortunately, with little success!\n\nThese days, I find most of my best ideas by reading and listening. especially to investment funds that regularly share deep insights into markets and individual companies.\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve built a personal collection (also publicly available via **RhinoInvestory**) of high-quality sources: newsletters, podcasts, interviews, and tools focused on finance and investing.\n\nSome of my favorites include:\n\n* [MAN Group](https://www.man.com/insights)\n* [Baillie Gifford](https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/uk/individual-investors/insights/)\n* [Neuberger Berman](https://www.nb.com/en/global/insights)\n* [Royce Investment Partners](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/)\n* [Hennessy Funds](https://www.hennessyfunds.com/insights)\n\nThrough these, I keep discovering interesting, often overlooked stocks like Shoei Co. \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5, Mensch und Maschine Software \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea, Turkcell \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7, and many more.\n\nHow do you go about finding new ideas? Do you rely solely on screeners? If you regularly follow specific sources, feel free to share them, I\u2019d be happy to include them in the database.",

We've yet to see even the first pilot plant built. So for me, this bull is very speculative and may provide shorting/hedging opportunities in the future.

Building a new AP1000 takes a decade minimum, no increase in demand there.   But there are many moth-balled reactors (most notably japan, usa, germany) that could be refurbished, and with nuclear getting popular, this is likely and feasible.  Restarts could increase annual U demand by 10% in the next 5 years.  \n\nAside, the interest in uranium mining and enrichment at the moment is mostly motivated by these factors:\n\n1, uranium is an inelastic commodity - demand is basically unaffected by U price increase.\n\n2, globally we've been dis-investing in uranium mining since fukushima.  After fukushima 48 japanese reactors were shut down, decreasing U demand, and bad sentiment everywhere.  There was a huge pitfall in U spot-price which stayed flat for a decade, and many U mining companies and explorers closed shop.  But you don't just fire up the mining drills again when the price of U jumps, it takes years to rebuild infrastructure, set up mills, etc.  High inertia in supply increase in an inelastic market with a demand peak, means big wins for those currently holding uranium.\n\n3, Unlike fossil fuels, which can go below zero if the market is over-suppied, Uranium is a remarkably easy commodity to warehouse.  Energy dense, lasts forever.  So, if the U market anticipates short term volatility but long-term growth, mining and holding uranium is a safe place to put money.",

Biden bolstered this in the inflation reduction act.  But in this bizarro universe where right wingers believe they are right about everything including things they know nothing about, the Trump administration along with the conservative congress has decided to pull the plug on solar tax credits which are building renewable energy today and giving them all to fake nuclear companies which will never be profitable.  Oh, and to make it all work, Trump had to write an executive order that says that the NERC can't regulate them, because how the hell would we possibly regulate hundreds of little nuclear facilities around the country?  And they would never pass.  Plus they're just terrorist targets every one of them and that's probably a bonus not a bug to these people.  So every time there is an article or a vote that pushes these things forward, the stock goes up.  But Trump will be gone before a single electron flows out of one so who knows if it will ever happen.  But there is this thinking trap among people with money.  They say \"I have money and I'm smart, and nuclear being part of the solution just makes sense to me, so it must be correct\".

There's been a ton of growth this year and it's taken on an outsized slice in the portfolio, so clearly I need to rebalance along the way. But, thinking about a 10, or 30, or 50 year prospect, I do give more weight to \"things I want to see happen in the world,\" or \"things I think need to happen.\"\n\nAnd I've been buying SRUUF, which is like a uranium commodity fund. They're pitch has the price hitting some kind of asymptote in 10 years. Mostly I'm just curious to see if I can learn and grow with a commodity that's growing in importance. I like commodity funds.\n\nAnd, I've let myself get roped into some light trading, less than 3% of the portfolio at any given time, rigid rules around buying and selling that basically amount to buying low and selling high.  And nuclear stocks are volatile in a volatile market, and make for good trading vehicles. I'd feel bad about it but I'm on pace to match my dividend earnings for the year, and mostly sat out April. Probably not reckoning with the time and attention lost, though.\n\nTL;DR I fundamentally like a long term industry trend, especially if I think it will improve my and my kids quality of life. I like nuclear energy, renewables, cybersecurity.",

Do you think energy companies give electrons away for free to large businesses? Why would there be no recurring revenue any different than the entire rest of the grid? \n\nAll of the companies you mentioned have an insane energy deficit at the rate of growth they\u2019re all on. And you\u2019re missing the thousands of other companies that also need power. Not to mention municipalities and consumers themselves.\n\nEnergy costs on the margins should *and need to* go to as close to $0 as humanly possible just for the US to maintain a competitive advantage.\n\nAnd you say china is a bad example while they have by far the most abundant energy production in the world and they add an entire US grid-worth of energy every year. SMRs are live and are functional working in and on advanced manufacturing that is far and wide better than the rest of the developed world.

Broad scale nuclear is diametrically opposed to American capitalism. Why would they fund massive projects to supply the average person? It's much more likely they do contracts with data centers and that's likely to represent a very small portion of their total revenue.\n\nSo what exactly am I fundamentally misunderstanding about electricity other than the magical thesis \"we (humans) need more power and  that means significantly more revenue?\"",

And sell the electricity to us and to large corporations and municipalities. And probably acquire them over time after capital has been deployed to build them. Like every other form of electric production today.\n\nIt would be naive to think all businesses plan to last forever and grow forever. Many, if not most, aim to solve a problem, and will be gone after the problem is ubiquitously solved. They either go to 0 or they get acquired. Acquired companies give liquidity to early investors, people don\u2019t generally lose their dollars invested when it comes to m&a. M&A=good for everybody, but especially stakeholders.\n\nIf you want to be Nostradamus and guess which energy companies will acquire the most nuclear, then by all means invest in the energy companies. If you believe in nuclear technology, invest in nuclear, cross the m&a bridge later when we get there.",

Everyone thinks they can achieve above average returns when only a very small percentage of investors can (and there is no way to tell who they are ahead of time or before they are out of capacity). 80-90% of us will do better with a low cost index DCA strategy with significantly less effort than if we pick stocks or funds on our own. Long term alpha is captured by very very few investors. Warren Buffett made it seem easy and I would argue that he has done much disservice to the investors that have tried to emulate him.\u00a0",

They will also have all sorts of policies like how much money they need to have invested and what kind of stocks they can buy.

But doing that 83,440-52,799 leaves 30,641, still not matching operating earnings 47,437 in the letter. What am I missing here? Or is owners earnings and operating earnings not the same thing? Then how operating earnings is calculated? I'm so confused lol\n\n  \nEdit:  \nI figured it out. It's taking the company\u2019s net earnings attributable to shareholders and subtracting investment and derivative contract gains or losses:  \nOperating earnings = 88,995 - 41,558 = 47,437",

But also unclear to me what they need to weather in the near term to get the business through this volatile time. E.g. if they need to adapt sourcing heavily, but then any tariff action gets reversed, they're going to get yanked around in ways that have an impact. Or they can just make the TACO bet, that's a more stable action, but of course it exposes them to short term pain.   \n  \nAZO could be a nice opportunity though if they get battered over the next few weeks. \n\nAlso funny seeing AAP spike back up on good numbers after their last call -- they seem much more rickety as a business, and were dropping hard before that.",

The funeral service market is largely dominated by 74% independent funeral homes (think mom-and-pop family owned small town services). \n\nEveryone needs funeral services because, as sad as it is, people will always be dying = infinite market penetration, geographic diversity, and non-discretionary consumer demand for SCI's services. \n\nOver recent years, SCI has used its [strong cash flows to fund a roll-up of these small businesses to expand its geographic footprint.](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=5c222721b8e16557fe1997add15c31aa822d8dd1edbafba8ea898cef6e119c3a) We can see a [clear upward trend in funeral service locations year over year,](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=e1b42b20b0b12e736b41ad6d6923947fa3f4a9870f58e30c879ac0a7f8c70b97) and these new locations will continue adding to SCI's available capital to fund more expansions. With this flywheel-type feedback loop of cash and infinite potential for expansion with these independent funeral homes, SCI can keep compounding its bottom line.\n\nI think this is a unique name that has its industry fully locked down, and I encourage everyone to take a look at the KPIs themselves.",

Net income declined 47%, EPS -47%, and revenue growth of just 10% has investors worried that growth is slowing. \n\n  \nPDD reminds me a lot of how Alibaba's stock trades. BABA is a great company yet they trade significantly below their American counterparts solely based on the fact its a Chinese company. If PDD was an american company with the same growth rate it would have a P/E of over 30 easily.",

The capital deployed in the business has soared from $77B in 2018 to $340B today.\n\nThese trends strongly suggest an incredible economic moat that is only getting stronger as the valuation compresses. Of course the valuation was extremely high in the past at 11x sales in 2018 versus 1.7x today, but it is clear from the numbers that this business is incredibly well run, has never been cheaper, and is generating top quartile (or maybe better) ROIC when compared to all global companies over $50B in EV.\n\nAs an investor, the harder question is what has to change for the valuation to expand because without that, PDD is probably a 12-15% year grower - which is great, don't get me wrong - but hard to see a double any time soon.",

However, my thesis was severely altered by the Trump tariffs.  The U.S. was significantly contributing to recent growth and the tariffs would squash that growth.  Trump\u2019s Liberation Day hit after 1Q25; so we have yet to see the true impact on PDD.  Additionally, the Chinese worker/consumer saw a negative impact in productivity and output from the Trump tariffs, so their consumption will likely to decline in 2Q25.  I sold out of my position around $100; I will re-examine after there is resolution on tariffs and we see more numbers out of China.",

Also lack of any forward guidance for a company of this size is shocking.\n\nThey have been saying since a few quarters that the profitability will take a hit as they are \"investing\" to support merchants. However, due to lack of any specific disclosure, the impact cannot be predicted and so when Q1 numbers were announced, the profitability hit was larger than anticipation. They have still continued the same commentary of profitability taking a hit and have committed a further 100 bn RMB for merchant support program. So I think the next few quarters don't look good for the company. They are running with a socialist objective and it is unlikely that they will be allowed to get a lot profits when the Chinese economy is facing issues. Ecommerce platforms are a major part of Chinese economy and the government will nudge these companies to increase/ revive the consumption at the cost of their profits for time being.\n\nAlong with these, obviously the impact of tariffs in going to be the highest in Q2 results. So I don't think this is the right time to enter. Once the Chinese economy shows some signs of revival, it might be a good time to enter then.",

The US is still the largest market for them though so short term, this might trade sideways to down. But I am trying to find a big winner long term. Thoughts?",

But I think shitty products at really low prices are becoming far more common (think Shein). This is where they play in the market and they play it well. Everyone knows what they are buying, and they don't seem to care. You can get 6 pairs of shorts similar to Lululemon (with a significantly shorter lifespan) for $10. It is still to be determined how demand will be impacted by inevitable price increases.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been researching $DLO (DLocal) lately and wanted to share my thoughts. Overall, I\u2019m pretty impressed. DLocal enables global giants like Meta, Shein, and Temu to access local payment systems across emerging markets - places like Brazil, Nigeria, and more. They build payment infrastructure country by country, which makes their service sticky and hard to replace. Once clients are integrated in multiple markets, switching becomes a huge hassle.\n\nThey have no debt and a healthy cash pile of $350-400M. They\u2019re still generating strong free cash flow even while investing in automation and AI. Q1 2025 results were excellent - Total Payment Volume (TPV) up 53%, net income and EBITDA both rose (https://valuesense.io/ticker/dlo/financials). They just paid a surprise $150M dividend, and starting in 2026, they\u2019ll distribute 30% of FCF regularly.\n\nThe main negative chatter is about the take rate dropping from around 4% to about 2%. But this looks like a smart move - they\u2019re sacrificing some margin to bring in massive clients like Amazon and Meta and lock in long-term volume. There are risks, of course, especially around emerging markets: FX volatility and regulatory changes. Their revenue mix is 75% Latin America and 25% Africa (mostly Egypt).\n\nThey just announced an Africa acquisition, adding 17 new countries to their network. The core business is asset-light, sticky, and growing. Execution looks strong.\n\nWould love to hear what others think about DLO!",

        "text": "AAON ($AAON) shares tumbled last week after the company revised its Q2 guidance downward, citing operational issues tied to the rollout of its new ERP system.\n\nThe $6 billion HVAC equipment manufacturer said it expects softer results this quarter, mainly due to ERP-related disruptions at its Longview, Texas facility. Going forward, AAON plans to implement the system site-by-site to avoid further setbacks. Despite the short-term turbulence, the company reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting mid to high teens revenue growth.\n\n  \nNow that the stock has pulled back \\~25%, it\u2019s worth revisiting the thesis, especially since several hedge funds recently published on the name :\n\n\n\n**Royce Invest in an article:**\n\n*AAON is one example. They develop heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) solutions for industrial and commercial customers. In commercial rooftop units, AAON has carved out a dominant position in the semi-custom market through consistent innovation, flexible manufacturing that enables customer-specific configurations to be produced at scale, and excellent distributor relationships. Semi-custom is a growing piece of the overall HVAC pie as more mainstream customers adapt to energy efficiency regulations and place a greater focus on indoor air quality and decarbonized delivery approaches. Through its 2021 acquisition of BasX, AAON gained a foothold in the high performance cooling solutions market for hyperscale data centers and semiconductor clean rooms. BasX\u2019s systems are highly customized and, similar to AAON\u2019s legacy business, manufactured with software-based automation that enables BasX to configure products to meet owners\u2019 unique total cost of ownership and operational efficiency parameters. BasX continues to expand its technology of cooling modalities (i.e., air and liquid) to meet the requirements of new AI data centers which has resulted in several announced wins and orders, putting the segment on a path to achieve $1 billion in revenue over time, up from $225 million in fiscal 2024. In March, AAON\u2019s stock plunged after management provided a muted outlook for 2025 due to a slowdown in rooftop unit sales driven by an ongoing legislated refrigerant transition and weaker non-residential construction, while BasX is managing through production inefficiencies as it races to bring on capacity to fulfill data center orders and backlog.*\n\n*While it will likely take several quarters to work through these headwinds, we believe these problems are temporary and fixable. We bought an initial position in the company as the stock\u2019s roughly 40% pullback since the start of the year created what appears to be a attractive risk/reward profile given AAON\u2019s competitive advantages in end markets with favorable, secular growth drivers.*\n\n  \n**Giverny Capital in their Q1 letter:**\n\n*In March, we built a position Aaon Inc., an Oklahoma-based manufacturer of semi-custom heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for commercial buildings. We\u2019ve been following Aaon for some time, and pounced after an earnings miss caused the stock to plunge.*\n\n*Aaon\u2019s HVAC solutions are popular with schools, shopping centers and other commercial customers with demanding air conditioning needs. Aaon equipment is configurable, whereas most of the giant HVAC brands like Carrier, Lennox and Trane mass-produce units. Historically, Aaon\u2019s semi-custom units cost about 20% more than mass-produced units, but deliver lower energy bills over their lifetime. A significant regulatory change mandating the use of more energy-efficient refrigerant came into effect at the end of 2024. Aaon says it benefited from the rule changes and can now produce HVAC systems for only 5%-10% more than standard units. Narrowing the price gap for new equipment should help it accelerate growth from already high levels: earnings per share tripled from 2019 through 2024.*\n\n*Aaon also has a large division that supplies specialized liquid cooling solutions to data centers, where millions of dollars of computer chips cannot overheat for even a minute. This division, BASX, has an enormous backlog and should grow for years. Our basis in the stock is a little over $79 per share.*\n\n\n\n**Royce Invest in another article:**\n\n*A new position in Royce Premier Fund, AAON (NYSE: AAON) benefits from increasingly strict HVAC regulations and the growing need for cooling in AI-heavy data centers. The company designs and builds custom rooftop units for commercial buildings and, through its BASX subsidiary, supplies liquid- and air-cooled solutions for high-density server halls. AAON\u2019s business model has distinct\u2014and increasing\u2014competitive advantages over legacy players like Carrier and Lennox. We expect that to translate into accelerating market share gains and earnings growth, while the company\u2019s growing role as a preferred supplier to the data-center cooling space adds an additional layer of upside.*\n\n*AAON\u2019s business model meets our rigorous criteria for inclusion in Premier. The company is a leader in the large and growing HVAC and AI data center markets. Equally important, its products are needed, regardless of the economic environment. Additionally, its equipment prices represent a small part of customer budgets, supporting pricing power. A significant portion of revenues is tied to replacement, which smooths demand through cycles. There is minimal debt on the balance sheet, and the business model does not require substantial CapEx, which helps generate high returns on invested capital.*\n\n*The market gave us a buying opportunity after AAON\u2019s shares fell about 50% from their late-2024 highs due to what we viewed as a classic market overreaction to two short-term dynamics. Shares of companies serving the AI ecosystem sold off when DeepSeek, China\u2019s ChatGPT analogue, stoked fears that AI infrastructure spending would slow. Then, channel destocking ahead of a refrigerant rule change caused an earnings miss in the December 2024 quarter earnings release (which was reported in February). We viewed both as temporary dislocations rather than structural threats.*\n\n*Those same refrigerant rules now work in AAON\u2019s favor. Beginning in 2025, the EPA banned high-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigerants in new commercial rooftop units, forcing every manufacturer to redesign their product lines. AAON\u2019s engineering culture and flexible manufacturing processes let it adopt these new gases with minimal retooling, while mass-production competitors must overhaul large, fixed-spec lines. The cost disruption for the legacy HVAC manufacturers narrows what had historically been a roughly 15% price premium on AAON\u2019s equipment versus commodity equipment and accelerates its share gain opportunity in a large addressable market.*\n\n\n\n**Brown Advisory Small Cap Growth in their Q1 letter:**\n\n*AAON Inc. (AAON) is a share-gainer in the core commercial rooftop HVAC market and has a fast-growing data center cooling business. Growth in the core rooftop business should improve in 2025 after an industry downturn in 2024 and share gains could accelerate as the price premium of the company's higher performing, more efficient units declines relative to competitors. The company has line of sight for their data center business (<$300M run rate today) to grow to more than $1 billion in a few years. We took advantage of share price volatility to initiate a position in the quarter.*",

Bad. \n\nThe reason for the collision has been confirmed to be a jamming of vessel navigation systems, still unconfirmed by whom but the result is that vessels currently navigate with a margin of error on their GPS systems of 100 nautical miles, effectly making them useless in the extremely crowded waters around the Strait Of Hormuz with an estimated 900 vessels currently located there. \n\nWhat does this mean in practice? It has greatly exaggerated the risk of navigating the area and more importantly, it's a risk a US navy presence can't protect against. In practice, this will increase the insurance premiums demanded by vessel insurers.\n\nThis is relevant because if we look to the Suez, it was never officially closed by anyone, effectively however, it was shut by the insurers as the insurance premiums demanded for vessels wanting to transition was so high it made it uneconomical to use the Suez. \n\nMy thesis remains that a real treat exists twords the reliability of the Strait Of Hormuz and the implications of a closure is currently not priced into markets whatsoever. The likelihood isn't high but investors, especially those in energy equities, should be aware of the risks and allocate accordingly. \n\nFor transparency, my full portfolio is listed below\n\nCleveland Cliffs $CLF\niShares MSCI Brazil $EWZ\niShares MSCI China $MCHI\nNew Fortress Energy $NFE\nNoble Corp $NE \nPetrobras $PBR\nScorpio Tankers $STNG\nSeadrill $SDRL\nStar Bulk Carriers $SBLK\nTorm $TRMD\nValaris $VAL\nVale $VALE\nWeatherford $WFRD",

Some time ago there was talk of a Transocean takeover but I think their current debt levels would make a takeover challenging, it would likely lead to share dilution via new issuance to finance a deal, I don't think Transocean is interested in that at the moment. \n\nIn short, Seadrill makes sense as a takeover target due to its high quality fleet and low debt, should a deal not happen I'm also perfectly happy just owning it because of the great dayrates currently earned by its drillships",

The business plan is extremely ambitious and with huge reward if they can pull it off, sadly tho, the disqualification from any further Puerto Rico power contracts might have been the death blow to an already extremely weak NFE. Their owner and CEO is a superstar but the obstacles do seem almost insurmountable at the moment... You can buy it as a lottery ticket, but size it accordingly, it's the highest of high risk, think of it as a biotech, it's all or nothing.

The following data is from Xclusiv Shipbrokers. As of 2025, the active tanker fleet comprises 7,735 vessels, with 1,366 units aged over 21 years, representing approximately 17.6% of the fleet. By 2029, the fleet is projected to expand modestly to 8,948 vessels, yet the number of vessels older than 21 years more than doubles to 3,023, accounting for nearly 34% of the fleet\u2014almost twice the proportion seen in 2025. The current tanker market is suppressed by the dark fleet, transporting sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil and refined products, using vessels aged more than 21yrs that would otherwise have been scrapped. If the US and Europe are successful in dismantling the dark fleet, tonnage will return to the regulated fleet, this will be done into a shrinking supply of tankers as the regulated fleet does scrap vessels when they hit \"retirement age\" to satisfy the demand of vessel insurers that otherwise refuse coverage due to the risk associated with old tankers",

I don\u2019t agree with everything they are doing from a moral standpoint but you can\u2019t deny that business is a cash machine. Might as well profit from it. Also like that they are reinvesting heavily in growth and innovation.\n\nGOOG is in an odd spot in my perspective. Company seems bloated with coasters hence the layoffs, but you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s one of the highest concentrations of gifted people there is. I have hope they figure out AI and retain their search market share. Also cloud computing business is doing well and the partnership with OAI can only help.",

Here is why.\n\nPoint 1\n\n1. Google is a monopoly and needs to be broken up because its hold is so strong.\n2. Google search is losing because of LLMs because no 1 is going to use search any more.\n\nStatement 2 directly contradicts statement one. If its losing revenue to the point where it just sucks then is still a monopoly? and if its a monopoly then how is it losing?\n\nPoint 2\n\nLLM is going to take over google search keeps being touted every where but tbh, google search hasnt been just search links for a very long time. For one when you search google the answers you get now already have ai built in. The answers you want are all listed in the first page, You get all relevant material from images to history to anything associated given to you with a gemini explanation all in 1 page.\n\nYou can then click on all links there to go for what you want. As chatgpt isnt gonna provide you with a live link to say a hotel or recommendations with reviews and maps all in one.\n\nGoogle has every single thing all in 1 place with live data. For the average person i.e not a coder. You want to find and book a holiday are you going to go to google type in a place and have it give you everything or are going to chatgpt then search back on what it gives you?\n\nPoint 3\n\nThe audience for people who do coding in where chatgpt is superior isnt the same as the audience as the general public. My software developer friend tells me chatgpt is superior in his work but for everything else he uses gemini.\n\nSure google will lose some audience but the vast majority of people arent going to use other llms when they can just search on google and not only will it give you information and explanations but everything you could possibly need in 1 place.\n\nPoint 3\n\nYoutube worth 20billion , tell me one single person you know who doesn't use youtube? you prob cannot. Its the fastest growing video web site. there is nothing comparable. Not even close.\n\nPoint 4\n\nGoogle cloud worth 13 billion, its one of the fastest growing segments. its only competition is azure and AWS but google cloud isnt going after the same audience.\n\nPoint 5\n\nWaymo, its already proven in 3 cities and will be launching in japan. It is the only automated taxi service that actually works and has no accidents. Its worth can exceed that of Ubers if it takes off.\n\nGoogle isn't a tough business to figure out, they just haven't marketed things in your face like the other companies.\n\ngoogle is consistent of\n\nsearch, waymo, google cloud, youtube, ad revenue, playstore/android.",

The latter is ruthless when it comes to business excellency. \n\nSundar has far less to do because of Larry Page and Sergei Brin\u2019s control of shares. They ultimately decide what happens to the company even if he has great ideas. They\u2019re definitely not dumb but they\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d and achieved their goal of creating an awesome internet company with subsidiaries (Google services and Google cloud). \n\nGoogle\u2019s main business is advertising and I feel like it\u2019s running into headwinds on where to actually put ads. They added more ads on YouTube (including premium) and have to compete with OpenAI now. If Search is genuinely replaced (it won\u2019t be for a while, but imagine if it was) then Google is cooked. Looking at all the projects Google has killed is not reassuring but it\u2019s actually for the better.\n\nMeanwhile, Zuckerberg wants to create an empire and reshape not only social media but human behavior too. Occasionally he has really bad PR like the metaverse idea in 2022-2023 that wiped out the majority of market cap but Meta has a chokehold on what humans like (showing off, connecting with relatives, and tapping into the element of sociability in general). Google can\u2019t do that.",

Still keeping an eye on ice cream segment growth (better margin but seasonality & some slow down). Not sure if they put \u00ab\u00a0frozen yoghurt\u00a0\u00bb in yoghurt or ice cream segment\u2026 I\u2019ll ask at one point. \nStructure of costs between domestic & abroad is interesting too, especially with export growth.\n(especially also as, on a short timeframe, costs grew faster than revenue).\n\nJumbo seems fairly valued, no debt, good dynamics on ROE and good gross margins. However, growth is slowing down.\n\nI do like these 3 \u2026 and, yes, unfortunately one is yoghurt.",

They are inherently risky as many of them are typically banking on one products that often takes years to even pan out. If they have any setbacks in their trials the stocks drop hard. Vast majority of small to mid-cap biotechs are incredibly unprofitable as well. Hard to view them with any real fundamental value unless you know a lot about the field etc",

He's extremely laser focused on moat, and I know that GE is his biggest holding right now, making up over 20% of his total portfolio in weight, which is quite, quite a lot, and he's mentioned these 2 in the past, and I'm looking to diversify away from my now very, very heavy mag-7/semiconductor portfolio, so I'd appreciate it a ton!",

They are booked for appointments all show long. $AIRI Positives: \n \n* Strong relations with Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon. Starting to make inroads in others. \n \n* Five years of backlog. \n \n* New machinery adds a lot to productivity. \n \n* Bookings way exceed billings. \n \n* Selling at a ridiculous 1/5 sales. \n \n* Supplies critical aerospace components, in some cases the sole supplier. \n \nNegatives: \n \n* Some legacy orders are operationally unprofitable. \n \n* Debt is way too high, $7.30 per share. That&#39;s the main reason for an ongoing loss and cash burn. \n \nConclusion: \n \nThere is a need to eliminate, or way pare down, the debt. Higher margins would eventually take care of that problem but the need is too pressing to rely just on that. Imo a sale of shares in the $3-4 range would do it. There would be dilution but the elimination of debt would be worth it, resulting in way higher stock ratios and share price rise. \n \nCaveat: \n \nI own lots of this stock.",

Unless it\u2019s some abnormal niche product, it\u2019ll likely pay off years down the line (Reddit isn\u2019t niche).",

Quite possibly a bit of both.\n\nI could realistically see it stabilizing in the low-mid 30s. It\u2019s volatile enough that I still think it would likely go sub-30 one more than one occasion. It really depends on whatever anchoring bias the market eventually decides to agree on.",

However, there's a ton of uncertainty in how *much* it will grow and on what time horizon. On one hand, people don't actually know what percentage of capacity solar can serve up for the grid to function well as a whole, which depends in part on transmission and battery deployment. Spain a few weeks ago laid bear that balancing things is important, and just plowing into solar capacity isn't the answer. But also, I don't think people have confident demand forecasts, e.g. from AI, data centers, manufacturing, which determines the total generation need. But no matter what, the grid is a mix of technologies, and solar is one piece of it -- and also, demand isn't going *down*. \n\nA quick look through the KPIs make ENPH seems like a well run company -- [tons of operational growth](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=97cae7d43f3810c8e57f7d5ae92c693ecf29c3c60d682177bee9d56d87418865), [growth in geographies](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=9fe8639ab650c325a3d0f2d3bd881a20ea9845d14ed5a7fe7c38170ea4afa1c7), even [customer NPS](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=195b6fd41ab70b4dd11a50d521230335ad5a9ae2b56b23db57805b3f6d46ea94).

For the UK, wind is more efficient than solar, plus the offshore wind farms work well with consistent wind speed. Also what are the chances of lower energy prices? With the US it can get stupidly complicated with different states (not to mention the chaos with interest rates, if Trump forces a big change how will that affect financing for panels? Thats after the tax changes and tarriffs). I am holding off from any US energy stocks at the moment until it is clearer what the direction and policy will be \n\n  \nIf your looking for more diversification, for wind i recomend greencoat UK wind. https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UKW.L/. I am slowly adding to my position (\u00a3700). The UK has some of the highest energy costs in the world and while the govt is spending more on green energy it doesnt look like it will be enough to make a large enough impact on energy bills. As the company pay off more debt from deals it should be a real money printer in the future. Solid dividend and growing at a decent rate. A good site for looking in on wind speed for the UK is https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/marine/offshore-wind/offshore-wind-map",

And I have to say that I mostly agree with your premises.\n\nBesides what other people have said I can think of two variables that can affect the future growth a lot:\n-  Duolingo has recently (on iOS) rolled out a new free version which seems to have turned a clear number of free users into paid users (whatever clear means). Although there are possible downsides this can increase their subscription revenue significantly. \n- They have released a lot of courses aimed at non-English speakers, think Spanish for Japanese speakers. This can open huge markets outside the anglosphere although the purchasing power is much weaker many of the markets. \n\nI don\u2019t invest in individual stocks, but if I did, I\u2019d be careful in buying Duolingo based on your analysis. And I\u2019m saying that as an extremely satisfied paying customer of the company.",

Because they grew into their valuation. Obviously no one can tell the future, but we'll have to see if they can do it.\n\n  \nI agree it is very expensive but these subscription based companies are king and they get really high multiples. Look at Spotify and Netflix as other examples. Subscription based companies are legit one of the strongest business models to exist. That's why everyone tries to introduce some type of subscription service into their platform like robinhood gold etc etc.",

FY 2023 and 2024 profit margins are above 20%.\n\nOn the KPI level, MNST clearly has the energy drink market locked down, with [energy drink case sales consistently growing period/period](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=afc304584f72b2750476ef97fb0cd480fa0c3ebafdd2d5d5e96006111e3bd894). Though net sales per case has dropped in recent years, [MNST saw a significant increase in the metric for Q1 2025](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=2a7c51be55f975a19d2a5924f7ba2b769f8fb1226b154051a7441773e7c996e3). These unit-level improvements should continue to drive revenue growth and sustain earnings performance for this year. \n\nMNST has made a name for itself as a big beverage conglomerate to rival Coke and Pepsi, with strong performance outside of its flagship Monster Energy drink segment. [Its Strategic Brands segment has significant period/period growth of its own to supplement MNST's top line.](https://www.revelata.com/share?id=367ef81254acc4339cc76ac75e5d1de3e3ca1546adcb64b7855c9c6da54721e4) MNST also sells alcoholic beverages, which hold even more potential for market penetration.\n\nThough its price is high, I think MNST's valuation is very fair considering its recent acquisition moves and consistent performance in a heavily competitive beverage market. Let me know what you all think!\n\n",

        "text": "Before you invest in stocks...you should understand personal finance concepts.  eg [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) can help.  Most of their advice is a bit formulaic but solid...eg max out your employer matches, max out your retirement accounts, cut wasteful expenses, invest in an index or etf fund, etc...\n\nAt your young age, investing is a bit different...you should focus first and foremost on building up your career/skills/education.  Starting a family, creating an emergency fund and getting a home might be important as well.  Paying off debt can be a great thing to do when young as well.  For some starting a business will a life changing decision...can't say that is right for you or not.\n\nWith that aside...the next thing to focus on would be your retirement plans at work and maxing that out.   You mentioned INR...are you in India? In the US, you need to understand some tax concepts and how to use iras.  You don't have to, but they save a lot of tax costs.\n\nWhen you figure out your tax structure and have maxed our your work options...the next step will be to invest individually.  Typically you want to open up a brokerage account. I use Fidelity.\n\nThe first thing you can trade are broad based funds that contains small slices of many stocks.  These are called etfs or index funds and are less volatile than individual stocks.  You can compare fund track records using portfolioslab...eg [https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison/NASDX/SCHV](https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison/NASDX/SCHV)\n\nIf you're ready to graduate to buying individual stocks, you should learn important concepts first.  The first is not learning to buy the right stocks...but learning to avoid the wrong stocks.  Warren Buffet has some nice info on this:  [https://www.youtube.com/@BuffettOnline/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@BuffettOnline/videos)\n\nLearning basic accounting and finance can help.  Here is a Youtube channel with some nice beginner guide videos for investors (most popular are the best):  [https://www.youtube.com/@FinancialEducation/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@FinancialEducation/videos)\n\nAt a minimum...I recommend investing just a tiny amount in some individual stocks so you can see how it works.  This way you can see how the price changes, how dividends come in, and why earning dates are important.  Be advised...IMO more than half of public companies have serious concerns with them, so if you don't know what you're investing in...it is a gamble, and you're better off with an ETF or index fund.\n\nLastly AI can help...eg [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/) will give decent personal finance advise.",

The stock has been \"depressed\" due to **\"perceived regulatory risk\"** in Sweden (think \"for-profit schools\" headlines), but our research suggests this creates a compelling opportunity.\n\nRead the full deep-dive report [HERE](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/stock-pitch-6-a-counter-cyclical)\n\n**Why we think $ACAD is a counter-cyclical compounder worth a look:**\n\n1. **Massive Free Cash Flow:** It's currently offering a **Free Cash Flow Yield of over 10%** for the current fiscal year (ending June 2025)! This signals strong underlying cash generation that the market seems to be overlooking.\n2. **Market Leader & Scale:** They operate 860 units across Sweden, Norway, Germany, Finland, and more, serving over 110,000 students. This scale drives efficiency and brand presence.\n3. **Consistent Profitability & Growth:** Despite market concerns, Academedia has a decade-long track record of \"steady profits and growth in the mid-to-high single digits.\" Net sales up 11.5% in FY24, net profit up 9.3%.\n4. **Strategic Diversification:** Management is actively hedging against Swedish regulatory risk by expanding internationally (international ops are 31% of sales!) and leveraging their counter-cyclical adult education segment (10% of revenue, growing during economic downturns).\n5. **Competent & Long-Tenured Management:** CEO Marcus Str\u00f6mberg has been at the helm for over 20 years, overseeing significant growth and disciplined capital allocation (acquisitions & buybacks).\n\nThe \"perceived regulatory risk\" in Sweden seems to be overshadowing the company's operational resilience and its strategic pivot to diversified, higher-growth international markets. We believe this is a classic value scenario for patient, long-term investors.\n\n",

How does one factor brand into the value of a company? Oh we TRY. We  have multiple theories and tricks people use to try to put numbers to these things, both simple and complex, but at the end of the day it is all a guess.\n\nLeaning so hard on numbers, and historic numbers for that matter, simply gives you a false sense of assuredness.\n\nValue investing is ALL about GUESSING the FUTURE cash flows of a company.\n\nWhat you are saying is that you take a company with historic cash flow growth and at least an okay balance sheet, and use that to convince yourself that is at minimum the baseline for the future. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Maybe they grow. Maybe they don\u2019t. You have to create a narrative to say that they will.\n\nI\u2019m have created a narrative that past management has abused the brand and the IP in an incredibly horrid way. My narrative is that the current CEO has SHOWN he is committed to the turn around. In releasing the value in their brand and their IP.\n\nYOU don\u2019t see value because, well, you don\u2019t.\n\nI see value because, well, I do.\n\nMark this comment and come back in a year and let\u2019s talk again.",

        "text": "Back in January, we flagged the stock as overvalued with a P/E over 40\u2014too rich for a small community bank with limited room for upside. But fast forward to today, and the picture\u2019s shifting.\n\nNBBK just posted a strong Q1, and now the fiscal 2025 EPS estimate is up to $1.39. Despite the growth, the stock\u2019s down 9% over the last 3 months\u2014meaning the valuation is finally coming back to earth.\n\nWith P/E compression underway and earnings momentum picking up, we\u2019re revisiting our outlook\u2014and the story looks a lot more interesting this time. \n\n  \nFor an in-depth review: [HERE](https://enduringequityresearch.com/2025/06/17/nb-bancorp-q1-2025-growth-and-strategic-deal-in-motion/)\n\n  \nInvestment Thesis:\n\nNow with a P/E of 13.7, NBBK trades below both their tangible book value of $18.20 as well as significantly below their CAGR of 26.3%. As a result, they now trade below the broader financial sector of a P/E around 22. Yet, they have displayed significant growth in each quarter since launching their IPO in 2023. With continued double-digit growth, we have updated our rating to a buy and increased our price target to $25.6 reflecting significant long-term appreciation around 57.8%. Here are the reasons we believe add intrigue to an investment in NBBK's stock.\n\n* **Pending Merger Agreement:** The June 5, 2025 [pending acquisition](https://nbbancorp.com/news/news-details/2025/NB-Bancorp-Inc--and-Provident-Bancorp-Inc--Enter-Into-Definitive-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx) of Provident Bancorp, Inc ([NASDAQ: PVBC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PVBC/)) further expands NBBK's branch footprint. It extends into the north Shore area of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The merger is expected to be approximately 19% accretive to NBBK's EPS in 2026. This is the first full year when the merger is expected to take effect. Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Provident will receive either 0.691 shares of Needham common stock or $13 in cash. Needham anticipates issuing approximately 5.9 million shares of its common stock in conjunction with the merger with the value estimated at $211.8 million based on the closing price of $16.62 on June 4, 2025. The deal is set to dilute NBBK's tangible book value by approximately 6.1% with an earn back period of about 2.7 years. The merger is expected to close in Q4 2025 with NBBK operating a merged 18 branches, total assets of $7.1 billion, $5.9 billion in total deposits and $6.1 billion in total loans.\n* **Robust Loan & Deposit Growth:** Double-digit growth of 12.9% increased total net loans to $4.43 billion. Net loans increased due to a rise in all major loan portfolio categories most notably; CRE increased by 15.1%, construction & land development by 20.7%, and commercial & industrial by 22.1%. Consumer loans increased 22% as well despite accounting for just 5.6% of the total portfolio. The total commercial portfolio increased 16.6% and accounts for a significant 66.5% of the total loan portfolio. There are a few gray areas in their loan portfolio. This will be discussed in full detail below under risk factors to come. It is worth pointing out. Total deposits increased by 14.7% to $4.33 billion primarily due to the increase in money market accounts and certificate of deposits.\n* **Revenue, EPS & Increased Profitability**: Revenue rose 12.5% to $47.4 million supported by net interest income growing by 12.7% to $43.5 million and total non-interest income growth of 10.3% to $3.86 million. NBBK continues to show incredible growth across all major metrics. EPS grew by 50% to $0.33 per share in Q1 and is expected to continue significant improvement year-over-year over 20% for fiscal 2025. Net income itself increased 45.4% to $12.7 million. Net profit margin grew by 29.8% to 16.45%, return on average assets increased by 28.2% to 1% as well as return on average equity grew by 49% to 7.3%.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nRarely do you find a community bank with such impressive growth, prudent risk management, and a solid balance sheet. To boot, Needham has a significant cash position in large part raised from their IPO launch in late-2023 of $313.4 million. When compared with their total debt position of just $98.8 million which did increase 49.3%, they have much more cash than they realistically need. For this reason, they have a pending acquisition. They repurchased 5% of outstanding shares during Q1 at an average cost of $19.06 per share. I think it is possible that Needham may issue a regular dividend in the future.\n\nThe continued impressive growth in profitability will provide an expanded footprint. There are no major changes in delinquent loans. The significant pending merger agreement will result in a 19% accretive EPS improvement in 2026. It will also offer a much larger loan & deposit base to work with. Despite a few concerns attributed to their loan portfolio, most notably the large concentration of cannabis loans that total $454.3 million, or 10.2% of the total loan portfolio, Needham is a very impressive bank. It now has an attractive valuation for long-term investment. This prompts us to change our rating to a BUY with significant long-term capital appreciation.",

        "text": "Something to keep in mind...is that ALL banks can be wiped out by a liquidity tsunami.  Banks gamble by borrowing short term low interest loans and purchasing long term high interest assets (maturity mismatching).  That can make a lot of money...but it is constant need for rolling over of the debt, as the bank can't really pay off the principal unless they sell their long term assets for a loss.  \n\nDuring a crisis, banks are forced to liquidate illlquid assets and it results in a runaway liquidity fire that spreads to other banks.  There is a mad dash for short term assets/reserves like a game of musical chairs.  The Fed will use mass corporate welfare to bail out the short term lending market to banks...sometimes it works...and sometimes not.  \n\nI was a Citigroup investor and lost most of my investment.  I will never again invest in banks.\n\nSecond...there is almost no such thign as a \"community bank\".  Most local banks simply fish out local deposits...and then sell them to upstream NY banks for profit.  If the big NY banks were to fail, the \"community bank\" would as well.\n\nNow NB Bancorp does have local investments though...but it is largely focused on home builders.  That is risky...home construction is facing pressure on four fronts.  Mass deportations will decrease demand for homes and raise the cost of home construction.  High interest rate will make it more difficult to finance home construction and to finance home purchases.",

They were this >< close to going under in both cases.  Banks are constantly losing and gaining reserves due to customer transactions, ACH, check writing etc... To balance out reserves lost, they borrow from other banks to cover their defects.  The inter-bank lending system was about to break down before the government bailed out the short term lending market.  Had they not done this, these \"community\" banks would have experienced major banks runs.\n\nYou don't see it, but the Fed is CONSTANTLY bailing our the short term inter-banking market to prop up maturity mismatching with emergency loans and using the fed funds market to ensure it stays at low interest.  The entire banking system is very artificial and an artificial government construct...thus is very vulnerable.",

        "text": "Time and time again, investors have been burned by trying to pick big winners and by overcomplicating a strategy that can be made very simple.  I think this is about to happen to Chris Camillo if he strays from his main strategy and tries blending his self labeled \u2018social arbitrage\u2019 strategy with this idea of chasing the big humanoid robot investment.\n\nWhen personal vehicles powered by combustion first hit the market, people really underestimated just how ubiquitous cars would become.  Yet, between 1890 and 1930, if you invested in a car company, you almost certainly went broke.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, there were over 2,000 auto companies founded between 1890 and 1930.  Basically all of which are now defunct other than maybe a handful.\n\nStudebaker was the household name, and \u2018safest\u2019 car maker investment set to benefit from this revolution.  Investors in Studebaker lost it all.\n\n\nThen came TVs.  And it was the same story.  Not a single American TV maker was a winning investment, even though every single household in the world has a tv.\n\nThis time is not different.\n\nThen cell phones and the internet. Almost all of the companies that looked like big winners with big brand recognition proved to be poor investments in this time.  Even Intel, which was believed to be the \u2018picks and shovels\u2019 investment of the internet boom, ended up being a losing investment.  \u2018Intel Inside\u2019 was a brand that every single person in the world knew and trusted BEFORE the internet and computer age really took off, but people didn\u2019t see AMD traversing Intel\u2019s moat so easily.   Tech bros believed that no matter which internet company succeeded, they would do so using Intel.\n\nBuffett was one of the ONLY major investors to come out of the internet boom a winner.  While everyone lost their shirts in 2000-2001, Buffett crushed it.\n\nYou might look back and think investments like Google were such obvious winners in 2004.  Everyone was using them! Yet, if you bought Domino\u2019s Pizza in 2004 instead of Google, your returns would have been better for the next 20 years.    It is a dangerous game trying to pick winners, even when you\u2019re right. \n\nFor over 100 years, value has proven to consistently be the best strategy.\n\nYet, Chris Camillo(and many others) are now constantly posting about investing in humanoid robot companies.  Specifically Tesla for its Optimus tech.   This is almost certainly going to lead to underperformance.   There are countless startups doing this and Tesla\u2019s moat is likely not as strong as it appears.    Even though humanoid robots may change the world, trying to pick the company that will be the best investment will be a huge gamble,\n\nAll that being said, I gave Camillo\u2019s book a read yesterday and I listened to a couple podcast episodes he\u2019s appeared on.  His bread and butter is a form of very simple value investing, he just doesn\u2019t brand it that way. \n\nHis main strategy requires 3 basic metrics:\n\n1 - Be extremely confident in the consumer behaviour of a very simple business.   \n\n2 - Invest early.\n\n3 - Invest heavy.\n\n\nNumber 1 is really a Buffett principle.  Invest in something that is super simple, and easy to understand.  If you can see that there\u2019s an obvious high demand for something and you are extremely  confident in your thesis, go for it.  \n\nNumber 2 is about paying a cheap price.  If you know the economics of a business are currently booming(or about to), but the price hasn\u2019t reflected it, obviously it\u2019s a good deal.   This means NVDA, CVNA, PLTR etc\u2026 are probably no longer holdings of Chris Camillo\u2019s.\n\nNumber 3 is also a Buffett principle.  Diversity is only protection against ignorance.    The higher your conviction, the more concentrated you should be.\n\nI think Camillo\u2019s strategy of gathering data from social media trends is actually quite brilliant and could potentially save value investors from being TOO early.  Value investors tend to jump on price drops when they know the economics are likely return to all time highs.  Camillo, on the other hand, waits for brands to start trending online.   Meaning, he will miss out on gains from margin expansion, he will miss bottoms, but he will also avoid the stagnant waiting periods that many value investors endure, and get all the gains experienced from revenue growth just before the market prices it in.\n\n Which, I think, is a pretty decent strategy if you stick with simple businesses and simple products.\n\nHe has said so himself.   His biggest wins weren\u2019t from revolutionary tech.  They were from Elmer\u2019s Glue, PF Changs, Lion\u2019s Gate etc\u2026\n\nIf you tried to use this idea to venture in to crypto, NFTs, ai, or other \u201cgame changing\u201d sectors, I think you would lose big. I think he will too, unless he keeps most of his portfolio in his bread and butter.\n",

They claim ZETA obtained misleading customer data, used it to bolster data collection and double dip on revenues.\n\nCulper claims over 50% of EBITDA is attributable to this practice.\n\nThe stock immediately plunged 37% upon the report\u2019s release. It\u2019s declined precipitously since, falling from its high of $38 down to around $12 today. \n\nManagement's Response\n\n- Management vehemently denies Culpers report. They state that revenues from the alleged consent farming sites accounts for < 3% of total revenue.\n- Deloitte (their auditor) subsequently issued an unqualified opinion finding no evidence of accounting trickery.\n- Insiders, including the CEO, CFO, and several directors purchased shares totaling $3 million\n- The board almost immediately issued a $100 buyback.\n\n\nManagement maintains their ambitious \u201cZeta 2028\u201d strategic plan:\n\n- \u2265$2.1 billion in revenue\n- grow topline at least 20% annually from today.\n- Adjusted EBITDA: \u2265 $525\u202fmillion, implying a 25% margin  \ufffc\n- Free Cash Flow: \u2265 $340\u202fmillion, representing a ~16% margin and a 65% FCF-to-EBITDA conversion rate  \n\nOutcome Potential?\n\nIf they are able to weather the storm and I would give conservative odds that they are at least ~50% likely to come out of this short report unscathed, with maybe some minor scratches, they are an easy multi-bagger within a short time frame. \n\nConsistent growth is an inevitable catalyst.\n\nI\u2019ll lay out a rough estimate of my odds making:\n\n0.5:2.5\n\nTake that bet every time.

Compared to its competitors, more specifically MPC they still outperform gas stations in terms of EPS (MPC had -$0.24)  but because over overvaluation the stock went from a 52 week high of $561 down to 52 Week lows of $388. That was today. \n\nAfter looking at their annual and quarterly reports, they're have become an undervalued money printing engine with quarter-to-date gas margins of $0.317 per gallon. If you don't understand that significance I'll tell you. They're Q2 2024 gas margins were $0.25 per gallon. Thats a 28.7% difference! \n\nI won't bore you with their flat line merchandise performance. Its been stale but not decreasing. \n\nGas= main cash flow generator \nMerchandise = company stabilizer\n\nThats why they typically have a .5 beta.\n\nAnyways EPS is $23.71\nP/E is 16.9\nForward PE is 16.34\nNon-GAAP is $2.63\nRevenue is $19.93B\nROE is 65.24%\n\nIt increases its dividends consistently (4 times in 2024)\nI like to be conservative as possible on my intrinsic values using DCF, P/E ratios, SOTP, EV/EBITDA.\nMy ultra conservative intrinsic value for MUSA = ~$410-430 (most likely ~$450-500 but again I want to reduce risk so I will always be ultra conservative)\n\nThat means I bought for ~7% MOS. Why? I intended on 10% but they revealed their operation update QTD (04/01-05/31) in post market today and the results were fantastic. I expect a rebound in the pre-market (if I'm wrong, they will at least decrease the bearish sentiment)\n\nTHE BAD\n\nObviously they are in the commodity business and that is as cyclical as it gets. The only safe-ish way to enter is through deep undervaluation. \n\nThey have a very narrow moat in location, tons of traffic, they mostly operate near Walmarts (mostly bought land Walmart, some is leased)\n\nThey have a very narrow moat in pricing, because they are such a lean company they can undercut competition.\n\nNOTE: Just my statistical analysis, not financial advice.

A few clicks later, he was on his way to being scammed out of $80,000.\n\nLindstrom, a college professor in Utah, invested in Jayud Global Logistics (JYD), a small Chinese shipping company whose price rose for months, then crashed 96%, just after Americans like him were told to buy it. Wall Street veterans say the pattern has been repeated dozens of times in recent years, and feeds on tiny Chinese stocks that are vulnerable to manipulation and easily bought by U.S. investors.\n\nTraders and investigators say it has become an epidemic of fraud, frustrating U.S. regulators who typically can\u2019t get access to evidence in China, even though the companies market their stock to investors in the U.S. The Justice Department is now involved with fighting the fraud, which resembles a pump and dump, declaring it a priority of the Trump administration\u2019s white-collar enforcement program.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEnd of excerpt\n",

I don't focus on any one industry, I go where the stocks are cheap. I usually don't care too much about the industry or sector, if a particular company looks undervalued to me then I'll do some further research on it to decide whether to invest in it or not. The selling part is the hardest. I find it much easier to identify if a stock is undervalued rather than when to sell. Sure it might have gone up 50% but it might go up another 50% or even 100% there's just no way to know. Part of investing is being comfortable with leaving some money on the table as it's extremely unlikely you are going to sell at the very top.",

        "text": "So I\u2019ve been doing a bit of digging into uranium stocks lately \u2014 partly because of the headlines, partly because I feel like the whole nuclear narrative is quietly heating up again. One name that stood out to me is **Energy Fuels Inc. (EFR in Canada / UUUU in the US)**.\n\nI\u2019m not claiming to be an expert, but a few things jumped out that make this one look kind of compelling right now:\n\n* **Uranium prices are creeping higher**, and it\u2019s not just a spike \u2014 there seems to be real structural demand. Governments are starting to talk more seriously about nuclear again, and the supply chain is tight. The West is clearly trying to move away from relying on Russian/Kazakh sources.\n* **The US just banned Russian uranium imports from 2028**, and there\u2019s talk of ramping up domestic production. Energy Fuels is one of the few US-based companies already producing (not just sitting on licenses), which feels like a big plus.\n* **They\u2019ve also got rare earth exposure**, which I didn\u2019t realise at first. That seems like a smart hedge \u2014 they\u2019re processing monazite sands and producing REE carbonate domestically, which ties into the whole \u201csecure the supply chain\u201d thing that\u2019s been a theme in both the US and Canada.\n* **Financially they look solid**. No debt, a decent cash buffer (\\~$100M from what I found), and they\u2019re not diluting like crazy. Small-cap, yes, but not a cash-burning black hole.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not trying to shill \u2014 just genuinely curious if anyone else here is looking at them. With uranium trending up, rising geopolitical tensions, and both the US and Canada pushing hard for energy and tech independence, this seems like one of those rare setups where the macro lines up with the micro.\n\nHappy to hear any counterpoints too. Anyone holding, or steering clear for a specific reason?",

When oil prices rise they charge more per day and become far more profitable. Additionally, as oil prices rise, the more contracts they sign because companies can justify deep water exploration.\n\nThe interesting part about these companies is that no one can or wants to build the ships/equipment to do this kind of drilling. It costs upwards of a billion dollars and there\u2019s very few manufacturing sites that can even build these ships anymore.\n\nSo the fun part about these companies is they\u2019ve almost cornered the market. It will take 3-4 years for a new drill ship to be created, so for now these companies have free reign. \n\nSo if oil does in fact rise and deepwater becomes popular - these companies stand to gain.\n\nThat\u2019s a bet I like",

I guess there's also the risk of AI eventually eating into their existing businesses too.\n\nBut lets not overlook the fact that they're regarded as having one of the best management teams in the world. A team that is well aware of the rising challenges in their industry. We've seen companies like Danaher pivot from industrial conglomerate to life science giant (although the real benefits of that shift have yet to be fully realized). So if anyone can adapt their business to a changing world, it's CSU's team.\n\nAt the same time though, at least in my eyes, it feels like the \"easy\" money was already made.",

I only sell it when I need it because I see it as a business.\n\nImagine you own a restaurant, you opened it, starting with zero customer. At year-end you have a line up around the block, you get rave reviews, and you have no way to meet the demand with the current location and staff. What do you do? Do you sell? Or do you open more branches? I would open more branches in other neighbourhoods.\n\nThen someone comes to you and say \"It is great that you have been successful with your business, but you only are 'successful' once you have sold it\". Is this true? No, because the business is a form of wealth, it generates value and income.\n\nStocks are like this as well. The stock market is vast, and so many strategies exist and you can do many things. You can treat it like a casino, but you can also treat it like businesses, which you choose will determine your success rate and how you approach it.\n\nI buy things and hold for years, think 10+. I bought TSLA at $2 and continue to buy every year, from 2012. I bought AMZN at less than $100 and continue to buy for 5+ years. I bought NVDA for nearly 10 years starting at like $20. I still own both TSLA and NVDA. Sold AMZN as i found better businesses to buy. These are just a few of my investments that I have own. \n\nMy success rate of picking stocks is most likely around 50%, but because I hold the winners and buy even more, it covers all my losses. Because the most you can lose from a losing stock is 100%. But if you sell, you can be losing 1000s%. Think about if your successs rate is 50%, each time you double your money you sell, then you would barely be able to beat the S&P500. What is really great is when your stocks 5x, 10x, 20x, 100x. Most of my stocks have at least 5x and above with some even reaching 200x. It can only do this because I buy and allow it to grow.\n\nMy return annual return rate is currently around 28-30% (this is per year) for the last 15 years. My approach is really opposite of most people on reddit though. I see stocks as something long term, a form of wealth. I do not need to sell to cash to see the rewards.\n\nCash is the worst form of wealth. You only need cash to buy your daily groceries, utilities, and when you need to make a big purchase. You do not need to see cash to see you have made money. If I sold my investments for cash right now, that would be so foolish as it would just trigger taxes, and what would I do with it? I do not need it to pay for my expenses as I currently have a job.",

Net return, often calculated as a percentage, represents the profit earned on an investment after deducting all associated costs and expenses. XIRR, on the other hand, is a rate of return that considers all cash flows, including multiple investments or withdrawals at different times, to determine the overall compounded annual growth rate.",

A significant portion of his success\u00a0*can*\u00a0be explained by exposure to value and small-cap factors ... but even after accounting for those, Buffett still posted \\~58 basis points per month in positive alpha. That\u2019s not trivial. It suggests that while he was certainly tilted toward known value factors, there may also be something uniquely persistent in how he implemented those ideas. I walk through the full Excel-based analysis using data from the Ken French Data Library.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 7-minute video here:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3wEsXzcdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3wEsXzcdA)\n\nI know this is a promo post, but saw in the rules that it's allowed when relevant and a \"free service\". I\u2019ve started a new channel exploring value, quant, and macro for long-form investing. Would love to hear how others here think about Buffett\u2019s alpha, and any feedback on the video. ",

It just tries to use a lot of statistics and then concludes \"Buffett really understood the market\". This leaves the impression that Buffett had a repeatable objective system in place, which he clearly did not, or many investors could crack the code and match his returns. He read the annual reports, he found great companies. It's not that complex, and isn't well explained by statistics.\n\nSince you mention his exposure to small caps, what percentage of his portfolio over that time period was invested in small caps?",

The regression analysis in the video wasn\u2019t meant to replace that, but to test a narrower question:\u00a0*how much of his long-term return could be attributed to systematic exposures like value or size*.\n\nInteresting, the regression doesn\u2019t show a meaningful small-cap tilt. In fact, Buffett\u2019s SMB loading was negative and highly significant over the full period, suggesting a\u00a0strong large-cap bias, not small. That implies he wasn\u2019t simply benefiting from a size premium. That said, I didn\u2019t analyze whether he may have had a stronger small-cap tilt at earlier points in his career, particularly when Berkshire\u2019s assets were much smaller and his trades didn\u2019t move the market. That\u2019s probably worth exploring in a future video.\n\nSo to your point \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think statistics \u201cexplain away\u201d his picks. They help isolate which return drivers\u00a0*can\u2019t*\u00a0be attributed to known risk factors, and that remaining alpha may be where Buffett\u2019s qualitative judgment shows through.",

And yes, it's entirely possible that the extra 58 basis points came from\u00a0market timing or capital allocation decisions, rather than pure stock-picking skill. Buffett\u2019s ability to deploy or withhold massive amounts of capital based on market conditions can be a real edge.\n\nInstitutional software tools like\u00a0FactSet, Bloomberg and Morningstar can separate performance into\u00a0allocation effect (market or sector timing)\u00a0and\u00a0selection effect (stock picking)\u00a0using the\u00a0*Brinson, Hood & Beebower* (1986)\u00a0framework. That model breaks down total excess return into their contributions from allocation effects vs. security selection. So yeah, if Buffett\u2019s residual alpha reflects\u00a0*when*\u00a0he deploys capital as much as\u00a0*what*\u00a0he buys, that would show up more in an allocation attribution model than in a factor regression like mine. Definitely an angle worth exploring further.\n\nI remember reading some of that timing literature while in my grad school program -- interesting attempts to isolate timing skill from static factor exposure. Probably worth revisiting in a follow-up video.",

If you watch my video at 5:41, the regression output actually shows\u00a0a significant negative SMB loading\u00a0(around -0.49, t-stat > 6), meaning Buffett exhibited a\u00a0large-cap bias\u00a0over the period, not a small-cap tilt.

But in the end I've concluded it's not worthwhile. \n\nAt the end of the day, you are buying a piece of a business, not currency/bonds. The performance of the business is not the performance of the currency. In fact,  (good) businesses are remarkably adept at working around currency issues. Even in extreme conditions. See for example the performance of Argentine or Turkish markets over the past few years - periods of very high inflation. Measured in a neutral currency, they did fine, or even well, because businesses can manage it. At the end of the day, currency is only settlement. It's a means to an end, not an end in itself. \n\nThe arguments against it apply doubly when you're investing in businesses which generate much of their revenues in foreign currency. American companies which have recurring revenue in euro actually, in a sense, benefit from a weaker dollar. It may take some time before you see this all shake out in your brokerage account, but it will. It's just noise.\n\nAnd there are always costs involved with hedging. You're adding drag for benefits that don't clearly exist. Not even true it necessarily reduces volatility in many cases, the opposite is often true.\n\nAlso if you find yourself only thinking about it when dollar is down and you're tired of seeing fx losses in your account, that is a terrible reason to do it. What about when dollar goes up? Very easy to get dragged into being a bad forex trader this way",

For example, Eur/Usd began the year at 1.03 or 1.04 I believe. I've had great gains while sitting on a load of cash, but because the dollar has weakened by 10+%, I am actually flat on the year. Obviously if now the rate reversed in my favour, I would be sitting on a huge amount of gains, but I would rather only have the performance of the stocks themselves drive value. Which goes to your last point, I would rather not take any gains or losses from fx. I would rather, for example, lose 0.2% to the associated fee, and be secure from fluctuation both on the downside and the upside. Especially as I am now probably going to convert my portfolio to Swiss Francs which is in a perpetual appreciation versus every single currency. \n\n  \nBut would you mind sharing how you have tried this out if you have done this?

I had a look and it is a Europe-focused (i.e. no direct policy exposure to the US) renewable power-generation player. \n\nBelow are the two core arguments for why I believe it to be a good short-/mid-term play.\n\n# 1. Management rejection of take-private bid signals potentially strong upside\n\nPrior to takeover interest in mid\u20112024, Solaria shares were trading at approximately \u20ac11.6. Assuming a standard 20\u201330% premium typical in renewables M&A, the implied bid range would have been \u20ac13.90\u201315.1. Yet, management rejected the interest, stating that the offers undervalued the company\u2019s intrinsic worth and long-term potential. The past few days and today the stock traded at around \u20ac8.8-9.0 \u2014> 35\u201340% below a conservative offer range that management rejected.\n\n# 2. Clear growth guidance, with upside flagged for H1\n\nIn the Q1 2025 earnings call, management reiterated their 3 GW target for year-end and hinted at further good news:  \n*\u201cWe expect to reach 3 GW by year-end, but we will provide more concrete surprises in the HY results,\u201d* the CEO said in the Q&A.\n\nAre there any other positives or negatives you see? Intuitively their focus on Spain and Italy seem reasonable. They also seem to have strong execution experience in terms of permits etc. \n\nExcept that we know that utility solar has the lowest LCOE. Lastly, the firm is also investing in Battery Energy Storage for which management suggested they currently manage to achieve payback periods below 5 years (without providing concrete IRR information). \n\n  \nWhat do you guys think? I am conscious most of you are US-based and buying European small-cap stocks is not usually in the cards. Though surely there is some European audience here, too",

        "text": "Because of Trump, Europe is starting to move away from US defence companies. European defence companies are getting increased investment and looking to collaborate in ways they didn't previously. For example look up the recent news on CV90 joint procurement from 8 countries. \n\nLockheed Martin has the only western made fifth Gen fighter in the F35 which is probably it's best strength right now but there are 2 seperate sixth gen fighters being made to be ready in the early 2030s so I don't think the F35 gives them long term dominance. Plus the rumours of f35 killswitches haven't gone away. My prediction is that once both sixth gen jets go online there will be a slow but sure phase out of US jets in Europe. \n\nWhen it comes to 4th Gen jets  we are finally starting to see Swedens Saab sell it's Gripen jet to countries that were considering the F16. I know Portugal are likely to look to the Gripen over the F35 because of cost and security reasons but there's similar noises coming from other countries like Canada France already sells Rafaels to the middle east and India. Airbus is at capacity with its euro fighter but maybe it figures out a way to resolve that issue in the next few years. Sweden has also given Ukraine one of its 2 Saab AWACs (swedish/Canadian product) that has already changed the battle for air domination in Ukraine by allowing f-16s to beat much newer Russian jets. \n\nMy point is that, thanks to Trump, there is far more competition from Europe now in the skies. Thanks to the war in Ukraine there's been a huge opportunity for real world testing of the hardware too. \n\nI see another top product of Lockheed is it's black hawk helicopter. That's going to be an even more competitive market. There's already a handful of European and Turkish competitors offering similar products for better prices (military rated in YouTube has some good breakdowns on these). The Hercules transport aircraft now has a big competitor from airbus too. \n\nMaybe there's enough business for everyone. But 5 years ago US companies dominated the western military hardware markets. Since the invasion of Ukraine and the moodswings of US leadership regarding protection and sovereignty, Europe has woken up. Watch the US MIC slowly but surely lose its most loyal customers. Will you replace all that in the middle east? I don't think so. Especially when you'll be competing with European, Turkish, Russia and now Chinese companies offering cost effective equivalents (5th gen jet excluded).",

It looks like the site is projecting a pretty big jump, and that inflates the DCF quite a bit. Same for NOC when I checked, maybe they are forecasting off of management guidance. idk.\n\nNot trying to speculate on global events or Lockheed\u2019s long-term role, but from a valuation standpoint, the sites 2025 assumptions feel a bit too optimistic. That bump raises the whole DCF curve and might make the stock seem more undervalued than it really is under more conservative inputs.\n\nAppreciate the post.

If you\u2019re a country building out/upgrading/improving your military, would you prefer a 5th generation f35 which rolls out constant software updates AND will have the ability to control unmanned drones simultaneously, OR, a 4th generation euro fighter?\n\nOK, ignoring the absolute tripe you spewed as if Lockheed Martin are the only company that provides software updates and drone compatibility (Saabs is literally advertising their AI for the Gripen and showcasing Gripen drone plans), I'll turn it back to you. \n\nWhy would you place an order for a highly expensive fifth generation jet now (and receive it sometime after 2030)rather than place an advanced order of a sixth gen jet now and just get by with very capable fourth gen fighters in the meantime? We're seeing fourth gen F-16s take down fifth Gen Russian jets with the help of Saabs AWACs so unless your country is at risk of a US or Chinese invasion before 2030 I fail to see the risk. And even if it was, then the US would disable your F-35 remotely anyway. Did you know that Boeing are producing the US sixth gen fighter? Who will bother buying the F-35 from Lockheed then?",

So you now agree there's reasons to buy previous Gen over current Gen lol?\n\n>Well first off, these orders are relatively small, and Canada is \u201cthreatening\u201d to cancel. Doubt this comes true.\n\nWhats relatively small? Countries signed up to the F35s before Trump so it's difficult to completely disentangle from those agreements but the fact is we're in a new world thanks to Trump and countries are going non-american as a result. These are all markets lockeed fought for so it's still business lost and part of a trend. Saab were in serious trouble as a company in the past because everyone bought from Lockheed over them. That's changing now. For example the Philippines seem pretty happy wit their purchase. Brazil are manufacturing Gripens which gives them sovereignty over their hardware unlike any F-35s. Portugal have already made their decision. So it's coming true slowly but surely. \n\n>Also, they can\u2019t be remotely shut down. We know that is untrue\n\nThe Wall Street Journal acknowledged that even without a kill switch a fleet of F-35s can be remotely disabled relatively easy by withholding spare parts, training and software updates - which the white house controls.\n\nBut hey buddy make no mistake. The F-35s are a really cool piece of kit despite some of the cost and operating issues they're having right now. They're the best jet on the market if they came with no strings attached and we're a nerfed export version. That's where the problem is. \n\nWe now can't competely trust the US anymore because the Trump administration threatens to invade allied territory and cuts off aid to Ukraine at operationallt crucial times.\n\nThis isn't like me arguing a Gripen is better than an F-35. This is me arguing that if I'm buying a gun I want the trigger to come with it and not have to rent it from Donald Trump.",

And MOST importantly for me - I understand the business the best AND, I believe it\u2019s one of, if not the highest quality aerospace and defense company. Also trades at a relatively low valuation compared to peers. I think 18-20x  FCF  seems like a reasonable bet here, especially with everything going on in the world",

Waymo is not what I think of when I use a $GOOG product, but admittedly I don\u2019t live in a metropolitan area. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a $TSLA problem. This is squarely on the shoulders of $GOOG treating the dozens of viable businesses they\u2019ve bought as some tech pet project for their \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d vision\u2026whatever the hell that is. \n\nI don\u2019t like $TSLA, I\u2019m not invested, but I actually dislike $GOOG more. I had $GOOG shares and sold last year\u2026and lo and behold, the company price hasn\u2019t changed and all these talking heads spout about $GOOG with a P/E in the low teens and the next AI move, blah, blah, blah\u2026\n\nThis is $GOOG fault for not spinning out Waymo. And why would they not do that? Because they know it would fail hard against $TSLA on its own and without the full backing and weight of all of the other revenue streams that $GOOG has at their disposal.",

I\u2019ve actually watched interviews with him and do like him, think he\u2019s brilliant, love his humility, and he\u2019s actually kind of funny for being a total geek!\n\nSimply put\u2026\n\n$TSLA = exciting, volatile, massive volume\n\n$GOOG = boring, almost $IBM like now, bland, volume suspect most days, zero excitement \n\nBut hey, everyone turns on YouTube!",

LESL is the largest retailer and wholesaler of pool supplies and equipment in the US.  Also a value investor Ariel Investments (John Rogers) has been accumulating shares and now owns over 31% of the company.  The company is highly indebted and growth has crashed post covid.  That being said, swimming pools are an attractive and growing market.  Once a pool is put in you are locked in feeding the beast.  It costs between $3 - 6K a year to maintain the sucker.  The company if still FCF positive.  I am scratching my head trying to suss out why Rogers and insiders are buying even though the stock is down 98% since its IPO and its balance sheet looks precarious.  They obviously have an end game in mind which is not obvious.",

        "text": "Levi Strauss & Co ($LEVI)\n\nFor data reference, use this link: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/levi/key-metrics \n\nFor this storied denim retailer, my impression was that it was a slow growth company and I wanted to find out if anything has changed. \n\n**Part 1: checking for safety:**\n\nIn terms of safety, Benjamin Graham\u2019s NCAV method has the highest margin of safety. \n\nAfter this, the other measurement which Benjamin Graham championed later is the \u201cearnings yield > 2 x AAA Corporate yield\u201d.\n\nThe AAA Corporate yield is now 5.41%\n\n2x the AAA corporate yield is 10.82%\n\nWell, to calculate the earnings yield, we simply inverse the P/E. Here the P/E is 18.79. And yield is 5.32% \n\nHowever,  if we back out one time recurring items, the normalised earnings per share (E) becomes 1.39. \n\nThe normalised earnings per share for the last few years are: \n\nTtm -> 1.39     1.25     0.81 <- 2023\n\nAverage is 1.15 \n\nI could use 1.39 (TTM) instead of using the averages. But to be conservative, using the average at 1.15 makes sense to smoothen any lumpiness.\n\nRecalculating the P/E ratio becomes $16.72 / 1.15 =14.539 , The inverse or yield becomes 1/ 14.539 =6.9% \n\nI would add the 3.11% current divided yield = 10%\n\nNow, earnings + dividend yield of 10% is still lesser than the 10.82% ( 2x of AAA corporate bond yield)\n\nLevi\u2019s as an investment is perhaps not cheap enough when compared to a safety measure laid down by Benjamin Graham.\n\n**Part 2: checking for the range of possible fair values**\n\n1. Past Revenue growth 1/3/5 years CAGR : 5.93%/1.5%/1.6%\n\n2. Past EPS growth (normalised) 6 years CAGR: 10.1%\n\n3. Fwd EPS growth forecasted CAGR 3-5 years: 8.64%\n\n4. Fwd EPS growth forecasted manually calculated: 5.8% CAGR\n\n5. Management guidance for this FY: revenue 4% organic growth \n\n6. Growth rates used: I would model growth at 3-5%.\n\n7. Assumptions:\n\nStarting eps: average EPS at 1.15 instead of 1.39\n\nDiscount rate: 10.5%  (The range is polled from 7.3% to 10.17%. I am using  10.5% to be conservative)\n\nTerminal growth = 3%\n\n**Fair Value**\n\nAt 3% growth, the fair value formula is 1.15 x (1.03) / ( 10.5% - 3%) = $15.79\n\nAt 5% abnormal growth rate for 10 years followed by 3% terminal growth, the fair value is $18.90\n\n8. Morningstar value is $23.50\n\n**Other Considerations**\n\nIn part 1, I find that Levi is cheap but not cheap enough to pass Graham\u2019s safety filter, but near enough. \n\nIn part 2, I find that the growth rate is all over the shop, the company experienced 8% growth within the USA and 9% outside, in the past year. This is above the traditional few % points growth a year historically.\n\nI think there is hope for growth rates to continue to grow faster, I attribute this to the three or four things happening: \n- new ceo, Michelle Gass since early 2024\n- renewed focus of the 501 straight cut for women\n- digital platforms like tiktok\n- lastly, they dropped the footwear segment\n\nIf they can maintain a 6% eps growth for the next 10 years, then the fair value goes up to $20.32, a 21.5% from the last price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These platforms are more ubiquitous than even Netflix and streaming as you can use them when you drive or workout or run errands. \n\nThe main hangup for me is that there is no moat, really. It's much different from a Netflix because Netflix owns the rights to a lot of their content where Spotify doesn't. With the exception of Joe Rogan, you can find all of their content on every other major platform. Unless that changes, Spotify will be squeezed from both ends: music licensing and content creator fees on one end, consumer pricing and experience on the other. \n\nIn essence, it's a commodity business. That could change in the future, but I've been unimpressed with the moves they've made so far. I liked the audio book inclusion, but it's not a huge needle mover. They've also beta tested Spotify learning (or whatever) where they include master classes (which I'm very bearish on). \n\nSo while the user experience may be slightly better on Spotify, I don't think they've done enough to distinguish themselves from other platforms.",

In a bold move to counter this, the company has made its largest-ever acquisition, buying the \"better-for-you\" snack brand Simple Mills for roughly \u00a3630 million.\n\nThis strategic pivot is designed to push Flowers into higher-growth, higher-margin markets. However, the deal was funded entirely with debt, significantly increasing financial risk and hitting short-term profits. The investment case now hinges on whether management can successfully integrate Simple Mills and grow it fast enough to offset the decline in its legacy business.\n\nFor investors, it's a story of short-term pain for potential long-term gain. The risks are high, but the company's confident dividend increase, even after taking on the new debt, signals that the board believes in the strategy. The stock looks cheap, but it's an investment that will require patience as the company digests its big bet on the future of snacking.\n\nFor a full and in-depth write up on the company see here: [https://dariusdark.substack.com/p/flower-foods-a-future-star](https://dariusdark.substack.com/p/flower-foods-a-future-star)",

It pays an 11% dividend. So while everyone is all \"WW3 is coming\" I still get the divvies.\n\nBest known: UNH. Down 10% Everyone is on a Debbie Downer with this one.

Currently he\u2019s got eBoost going, and they just started marketing HOMe-Boost, a large backup battery for your house. \n \nI also think there\u2019s a possibility there\u2019s a big deal in the works. They announced a pilot program for last mile delivery for a \u201cfortune 100 retailer\u201d. I think they may be working on a deal with Amazon for their eBoost chargers for Amazon delivery trucks. It\u2019s just a pilot program for now, but if it gets rolled out on a larger scale could be quite large relative to the size of the company.\n \nDown a bit on Subaru and I\u2019ve cut the position post liberation day, but again the large cash balance should protect the downside fairly well. 40% of manufacturing in the U.S. and has a good following among Subaru enthusiasts. \n \nAlso down a bit on my oil stocks - Japan petroleum and OXY. Still waiting on a better oil price environment\u2026 Middle East tensions have helped a bit\u2026",

And it's not even like they're losing money now. \nSure, they cut dividends which is part of the reason for the price drop but they only did that because not only is the share price cheap, but their debt is cheap too. For every $1 that they spend buying back their debt, they're reducing their total future debt payments by $3. Even in a not great year (last year), they still managed to buy back a good chunk (maybe 30%) of their debt at a huge discount. And they STILL managed to pay out a (small) dividend. \n\nIt's also the 3rd most shorted stock according to Yahoo finance, probably the only stock in the top 50 list that neither has substantial litigation against it, nor has any chance of bankruptcy in the next 5-10 years. The number of old people shopping there is still enough to keep them afloat. \n\nIn my opinion, if a stock is trading at even 5% below liquidation and it's still a (even slightly) profitable company, and someone decides to short sell it, that person is an idiot. There's even a subreddit now called \"r/KSSbulls\" where about 500+ of us think it's absolutely ridiculous that a (slightly) profitable company is getting shorted even being well below liquidation value. It's completely ridiculous, and even if there isn't a short squeeze (which there's a decent chance of), most of us expect the stock price to return to $40 or more within a year or so.",

Add in a few political chaos bits, tariff uncertainty. Yes, only large-moat corps can wait shit out forever.\n\n\\--\n\nNext check: how many retail-trading Poors are out there? Hm, well, a lot. There's a whole movement about how stocks will be easy money. K, what are they going to invest in?\n\nBlue chips seem kinda stupid for them. They don't grow fast, even at best. Nice perk for those who can afford to hold 10 years, however.\n\nMass AI acceptance = mass office-worker layoffs over AI, = greater unemployment rates = 401ks unlocked = funds used for either bare necessities or the hope of a better financial future. Where else but Blue Chips and the S&P?\n\nEstimates of S&P gains - 3% annual, I believe, pre-fees. NASDAQ - tech-heavy, AI-heavy, susceptible-heavy to over-exaggerations of AI success.\n\nOnly bet necessary: Reports of AI competency have Been Greatly Exaggerated.",

With that in mind, I have to make decisions on what to include and how to write so that it adds value. Based on my experience, incredibly long posts with all the details perform poorly.\n\nI've considered all the points you've mentioned, with the exception of the NI increase. Here's my response:\n\n\\- Large part of the LFL growth is driven by inflation. As inflation is not known, I decided to estimate the future growth together with the growth coming from new locations. In my opinion, splitting them gives a fake confidence that I am in control of those variables, which I'm not.\n\n\\- For the premium, the reason why I didn't include is, it is subjective. The valuation excluding premium is there. If the reader thinks a 10%, 20%, 30% premium is deserved, that's easy to apply.\n\n\\- Lastly, the NI part, that I didn't consider at all - In general, costs are being passed on to the final consumer. It's yet to be seen if the price increase will deter customers, or they'll remain loyal. My assumption is, nothing will change. Of course, I could be wrong.",

I think Canadians and parts of the US would definitely love this, but their main competitive edge is that they don't bake or really prep much of anything at the actual locations, so it's very fast. Their baking is done in bulk, at scale, then shipped out to stores. This is kind of like the 7-Eleven model for food in Japan or Taiwan.\n\nThe reason why these concepts don't really work well in the US and Canada is simply that there is too much space. These types of stores can't achieve the location density needed to really make their business model shine.\n\nIn other words, the whole value proposition falls apart without location density.\n\nThey have plans to scale up to 3500 stores in the medium term in the UK, which is 35% more than they currently have as far as I can tell. Can the UK support this many stores? I really don't know as I'm not very familiar with the UK market, but I could be concerned with oversaturation.\n\nThis would be similar to the 17k people per Subway store in the US, and Subway is kind of known for cannibalization of stores due to too many locations. I would be very concerned with this level of penetration in the UK because same store sales might start dropping, which defeats the point of opening new stores.\n\nCan someone from the UK chime in?",

My assumption is sales/capital ratio of 5. In a nutshell, for every 5 GBP growth in revenue, they need to invest 1 GBP, whether that is in equipment or working capital.\n\n  \nI hope this helps!",

Appears they finally smoothed out the Honeywell acquisition as well.  Long term annual growth says 35% in 5 years...which if true they are crazy under valued at only a forward pe of 17.98.\n\nOn the flip side they are somewhat over dependent on a few major customers (Boeing, Airbus, Delta), and very dependent on military contracts which are fickle.  They also don't have a long track record which is a concern.\n\nI don't have an exact price target, but I am bullish on the company.",

A prolonged conflict with potential U.S. involvement could drag SPY lower, especially if energy prices spike and hurt consumer/inflation-sensitive sectors.\n* Volatility Spike: VIX likely rises. Rotation may occur into defensive stocks (healthcare, utilities).\n\nCrude Oil (WTI/Brent)\n\n* Upside Risk: Iran is a top OPEC producer. Any disruption to Hormuz Strait shipping or Iranian production (e.g. South Pars gas field hit) could spike oil >$100/barrel.\n\nGold (Spot Gold or GLD ETF)\n\n* Bullish Pressure: Classic safe-haven. Surges amid war headlines, central bank buying, or perceived U.S. entanglement.\n* GLD will likely attract short-term capital inflows as traders hedge equity exposure.\n\nLMT (Lockheed Martin)\n\n* Bullish: A direct beneficiary of heightened military action and arms support. Strong global order book may expand.\n* Extra Catalyst: Potential U.S. support for Israeli air defense systems and bombs.\n\nRTX (RTX Corporation)\n\n* Bullish: Heavy exposure to missile defense and radar systems. May benefit more directly than LMT if U.S. ramps up Middle East presence.\n\nXOM (Exxon Mobil)\n\n* Moderately Bullish: Gains from higher oil prices, but some exposure to Middle East assets may introduce risk.\n\nFANG (Diamondback Energy, Inc.)\n\n* Bullish: U.S. shale-focused, benefits directly from crude rally with no Middle East risk.\n* To elaborate a bit more though on FANG:\n* Diamondback\u2019s Margins Are Highly Sensitive to Crude Prices\n   * Diamondback\u2019s Permian wells are among the lowest-cost in the industry, with estimated break-even between $35 and $45 per barrel\n   * Diamondback has pledged 70\u201375% of free cash flow back to shareholders (via dividends and buybacks). If WTI holds above $90, this could accelerate materially.\n   * The current market likely **d**oes not price in a long tail of elevated crude. Diamondback stock could run higher if consensus shifts from \"$70\u2013$80\" to \"$90+\" WTI long-term.\n   * A wider spread (e.g., $5 to $10) incentivizes more U.S. crude exports. Diamondback, as a Permian producer with access to Gulf Coast pipelines, directly benefits from higher export pricing.\n\nPlease Share Your Thoughts as well?\n\n\\-Articles Sourced and Aggregated From: [Marketflux.io](https://Marketflux.io)",

If I hadn\u2019t been in that large cap, it would have taken way longer to come out of that drop. I finally sold the target fund in February, and that\u2019s when I saw everything was at an all time high again. So I sat on my money market and then the tariff crap started.

Nothing wrong with holding, just watch if it starts becoming a huge chunk of the portfolio.\n* BRK.B is a solid anchor too \u2014 great defense, great offense.\n* With that $3k in cash, you could slowly DCA into your underweight positions or just keep it for when the market dips. No pressure.\n\nOnly thing maybe worth thinking about is adding some international exposure down the line (5-10%) \u2014 not urgent, just something to consider for balance.\n\nOverall though?

IMO too much expose to insurance, which I believe had a one-time insurance spike and which investors thought was the start of a long growth cycle.  It's not.  Other concer is too much cash...about a third.  I think Buffet is not reading the market correctly...his GDP measure of market value is outdated because of international markets and tech.  The money supply continues to climb sharply and will take stocks with it.  Huge mistakes to over-emphasize treasuries IMO.\n\nFor QQM, it's an ok fund. I have a similar Nasdeq 100 fund myself (NASDX).  But...it is really emphasizes 10 companies for just the holdings....many of which are likely overvalued or facing serious future question marks:  [https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)\n\nNVIDIA I'm bearish on.  I think they will continue to grow great for the next few quarters...but they are running out of room to grow.  We're also like on an AI bubble.  Their AI chips are pricey and use closed tech...AMD could seriously cut into their revenue.",

It's great for basic research, if you give it more specific instructions, it tends to make less mistake. But ultimately, you need to make the decision.\n\nThe technology isn't there for your use case. The longer the response, the more mistakes it will make.\n\nI use it to analyse the key financial numbers with detailed instructions to help me narrow down the companies I'm interested in but once that's done, I'll verify and make my own decision",

        "text": "The companies you mentioned AVGO, Nvidia, ARM and AMD, are NOT average semiconductor companies. They are valued based on the projected growth in AI and the overall computing needs which they are all heavily invested in. Look up Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, NXP, ADI, Skyworks, CRUS, those are your average semi-stocks. They are all 20-30 PE range. TSMC is a huge slow moving ship that\u2019s in the foundry business and can\u2019t potentially grow as quickly as Nvidia can. Look up their peers such as UMC, even Samsung. So 80 PE would be crazy high for TSM. More realistically it could reach 40-50 if based in the US, but it\u2019s based in Taiwan. So you have to factor in the geopolitical risk. If you are already holding Nvidia or Apple for example, you are already exposed to that specific geo-political risk, so the question is\u2026 Do you want to pile in more exposure? I agree with you that 20PE is likely low, but the upside likely isn\u2019t as high as you think.",

If they were to invade they would be taking the route imperial Japan took in WW2. Japan at the time needed resources desperately and was strong in relation to its neighbors and even the US. Right now China is enjoying trade with the world which has lifted its population out of poverty over the past 20 years. To jeopardize that at this point in time would be silly.

They're well-written, friendly and invaluable to all levels of interest/expertise, and available at a price that would make Benjamin Graham smile.  \n\nThe partnership letters are much more granular in their detail than the shareholder letters that follow and because of the period during which the partnership was in operation, the case studies are more of the Graham-style investments.  For that reason, they'll be of more interest to the people on this sub than anyone who doesn't explicitly identify as a value investor.  \n\nBut to laymen or beginners, it's obvious to me that they should start with the shareholders' letters.  My personal recommendation is to start with the 2010 letter as that's the one immediately following Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of BNSF which, unlike most investments, was made partially with stock so a bunch of new shareholders were added and the chairman greets them with a grander introduction to Berkshire's philosophy of operation than what you get in most letters.  I think the best thing is to start with that one, and then go back to the very beginning.  He does repeat himself but it's worth reading these things multiple times.  \n\n*Then*, if you're as hopelessly sold as the rest of us, go back to the partnership letters.",

        "text": "So the company is Cegedim, a small cap you probably haven't heard about.\n\nAt first glance, it looks really bad, 10 years straight of price decline.\n\nThe fundamentals paint a somewhat different picture. They have steady revenue growth, not all organic, but they do have about 2% organic.\n\nOperating income is also good, cash from operations good, gross margins on a slight rise since a couple years. On paper looks quite good. Debt on the high side (but not high as the EV vs market cap suggests, since the market cap is tiny due to extremely low price).\n\nSo what is the problem? I think one is that because of their mixture of businesses, it requires a discount. The second is that despite the very solid cash from operations, they never seem to generate any actual fcf that goes to shareholders.\n\nAt EV/Ebitda of 2 I think it's a risk one can take, it's not a declining business after all, just one that seems to be inefficient. The metrics are trending well positively in the last 2 quarters, and I think the low share price will put some pressure on management to increase efficiency.",

This stock is down a massive **60% from its highs**, and some analysts point to 50%+ upside.\n\n**But we're saying: DON'T BUY IT. Not yet, anyway.**\n\nRead the full report [HERE](https://tscsw.substack.com/p/stock-pitch-4-dont-buy-amadeus-fire)\n\nWhile there's long-term potential (German labor shortage, specialized niche), the near-term picture is frankly, grim, and it presents a potentially costly mistake for investors jumping in now.\n\nHere\u2019s why, straight from our research:\n\n* **German Economy Crushing It:** Their personnel services (60% of revenue) are directly tied to the German economy, which is currently very weak. Companies are simply not hiring.\n* **Margins Collapsing:** Operating EBITA margin plummeted to a shocking **4.4% in Q1 2025** (from 12.6% a year ago!). This isn't just a dip; it's a severe squeeze from lower revenue and rising costs.\n* **Training Segment Also Struggling:** Even their \"counter-cyclical\" training business saw a **6.5% revenue decline and a 75.9% drop in EBITA** in Q1 2025 due to specific issues like platform listing changes.\n* **Divergent Forecasts:** Analysts are all over the map. Some optimistic forecasts for 2025 revenue seem out of sync with current trends and the severe Q1 performance. If the conservative forecasts are right, the \"upside\" is much smaller.\n* **EPS Nosedive:** Earnings per share were down a staggering **89.2% year-over-year in Q1 2025**. This isn't a \"temporary setback\" for your immediate returns.\n\nWe believe the current valuation, despite appearing \"cheap,\" doesn't fully reflect the depth of the near-term challenges and margin destruction. While the long-term story for skilled labor in Germany is real, waiting for clear signs of stabilization and margin recovery is critical.\n\nWe've broken down all the financials, competitive landscape, growth drivers, and *why* we believe patience is key.",

        "text": "The recent surge in precious metals has caught many investors' attention, with gold and silver mining stocks posting significant gains. As value investors, it's worth examining whether this presents genuine investment opportunities or merely speculative fervor.\n\nGold has been trading near multi-year highs around $2,500-3,500 per ounce, while silver hovers around $30-40. This has lifted mining stocks considerably - Endeavour Silver gained approximately 10%, First Majestic Silver and Coeur Mining each rose about 6%, and Harmony Gold increased roughly 5% in recent sessions.\n\nThe driving forces behind this rally include persistent inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions creating safe-haven demand, central bank gold purchases, and currency debasement fears.\n\nFrom a Buffett-Munger perspective, gold itself is a non-productive asset. As Buffett famously noted, gold \"gets dug out of the ground... then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it.\" However, well-managed mining companies can represent genuine value if they have low-cost operations with long mine lives, maintain strong balance sheets with manageable debt, generate consistent free cash flow, and trade below intrinsic value based on reserves and production capacity.\n\nWhen analyzing precious metals miners, I focus on cost structure where all-in sustaining costs (AISC) should be well below current metal prices, providing a substantial margin of safety. Companies with AISC under $1,200/oz for gold have historically been more resilient. Reserve quality is crucial - proven and probable reserves indicate future production potential. Look for companies with 10+ years of mine life and growing reserve bases.\n\nFinancial strength matters significantly. Net debt-to-equity ratios below 0.3 and current ratios above 1.5 suggest financial stability during commodity downturns. Management quality shows through track record of capital allocation, avoiding value-destructive acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders during good times.\n\nWhile current prices may seem elevated, several structural factors support precious metals. Supply constraints exist as new major discoveries are increasingly rare, and existing mines face declining grades. Continued fiscal deficits and low real interest rates historically favor hard assets. A 5-10% allocation to precious metals can reduce overall portfolio volatility.\n\nValue investors must acknowledge the risks: commodity price volatility can severely impact earnings, regulatory and political risks exist in mining jurisdictions, environmental and social governance challenges persist, and capital intensity creates execution risks for mining projects.\n\nRather than chasing momentum, I prefer dollar-cost averaging into quality miners during market weakness, focusing on companies with strong fundamentals trading below book value, maintaining position sizing appropriate for the volatility (typically 5-10% of portfolio), and avoiding speculation on junior miners or short-term price movements.\n\nWhile the current precious metals rally creates excitement, value investors should remain disciplined. Focus on companies with strong fundamentals, reasonable valuations, and sustainable competitive advantages. The key is finding businesses that can generate attractive returns across commodity cycles, not just during bull markets.\n\nAs Graham taught us, the intelligent investor looks for intrinsic value, not market sentiment. In precious metals, that means analyzing the underlying businesses, not just betting on metal prices.\n\nWhat's your experience with precious metals miners? Have you found any companies that meet strict value investing criteria in this sector?",

Cause if inflation is going up, guess what else is going up? Oil, rubber, labor, food (worker camps) even the cost of money goes up if they have debt on their balance sheets.\n\nIt's a very complicated industry to be in, as an investor. Now speculating?

However their strength lies in the pile of cash they are sitting on. Their net cash is 430 million AUD, which exceed the market cap by 100 milliom. On the other side their payout ratio is low to none. Unfortunately they dont pay dividend currently and their buy back program is very limited ( in H1 2025 they only bought 1.5%, which is at their historical maximum.) \n\n\n\nMount Gibson produce high quality iron ore and its revenue and margins are thus tied to price of this commodity. Due to recent impairments in reserves, Mount Gibson operating margin is negative and currently operations doesnt look too hot because of stagnating price of iron ore. FCFF on the contrary was 9% in the last year and averaged 18% over the past 25 years. \n\n\n\nThe company has bought last year shares in FELIX corp, another australian Iron miner, worth 20 million AUD and in addition has invested 2 million aud in exploration. Further in Q1 conference CEO said that they want to spend the money on a new project by the end of the year. The project would be either coal,copper or iron ore mine. They arent really decided and are still exploring in the market.\n\n  \nAlso company has a big liability of 55 million AUD of abandonment cost ( they have to return their mine into environmentaly friendly place). \n\nStill net assets after deducing mine PP&E are 410 million AUD ( By the way they dont have any goodwill nor intangible).\n\n  \n\n\nThe low price? \n\n\n\nI think the low price is because of \n\na) stagnating price of iron ore\n\nb) low payout ratio ( and the management willingnes to keep company operational, rather than buying back all the stocks or paying hefty dividend)\n\n\n\nAdvantages? \n\nA) Having a cash in turbulent times and willing to spend it in bottom of cycle on new project. \n\nB) its NET NET",

I know iron ore has been under pressure ever since China\u2019s housing slump started and ever since China started to cut back on steel overcapacity. \n \nSeems like they will be still generating cash until the mine winds down? Aside from the impairments, looks profitable to me. \n \nSometimes the abandonment costs can run over. But still seems small enough in magnitude that the leftover cash would still be really substantial. \n \nWould also be interesting to see what they end up acquiring. Could fritter away a lot of the cash on speculative early stage miners. Not sure if there is any track record on management\u2019s decision making here. \n \nCould be some good outcomes here with decent downside protection from the cash position. Seems like a decent net net to me.",

        "text": "Thanks for the feedback! Whats mindblowing is that they are reporting buybacks DAILY. In each daily buyback document you can see how much shares they have bought overall and how much have they bought last day. The 3.5% market cap you are referencing to is actually how much shares they have bought in their overall history. I came to 1.5% market cap by substracting total amount of treasury shares by total amount of treasury shares as of 31 december 2024 ( so only including treasury shares in the year 2025)\n\nOkay, the troubling thing that you have pointed out is that we dont really know what the next acquisition will be. Their latest acquisition was Shine ore mine located in Western Australia and it was made 11 years ago and for only 15 million AUD ( [https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014.03.07-Acquisition-of-Shine-Hematite-Project-Completed.pdf](https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014.03.07-Acquisition-of-Shine-Hematite-Project-Completed.pdf) ). They have sold it to Fenix for 35 AUD 2 years ago ( summed cash, warrants and stocks in FENIX, [https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MGX-Completion-of-Mid-West-Transaction-24-July-2023-Final.pdf](https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MGX-Completion-of-Mid-West-Transaction-24-July-2023-Final.pdf) ) . HOWEVER it was sold it with a railway and other iron ore mine and it would take me very long time to see whether they profited from the acquisition.\n\nThe bigger acquisition was done in 2007 ( which was actually a merger) , where the current iron ore mine was acquired ( Koolan Island). It had 22.5 million metric tones of proved iron ore ( price of iron ore back then was 33 US dollars per ton) reserves and 32 million of equity. Keep in mind that reserves have increased through time and the operation life was prelonged. In first quarter . Mount Gibson had to dilute 355 million shares for the merger, which was back then where the stock price was pretty stable 250 million AUD. I think it was a good deal, because they have bought an mine that was in the end phase of developement and was debt free.\n\nLink for this acquisition: [https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/360879.pdf](https://www.mtgibsoniron.com.au/wp-content/uploads/360879.pdf)\n\nFortunately Mount Gibson has reported how much iron ore have mined in the Koolan Island overtime. Its 36.6 million tones( data from 2023). So they have made : 32 milions from acquired equity + 36.6 \\*101 ( average price of iron ore based on FRED macrodatabase) \\* ( 0.76  AUD to USD estimated average by eye from chart) \\*0.18 ( FCFF margin, based on previous analysis). That is 537 millions AUD! Well beyond the 250 million AUD purchased price. So even though this estimate is totally wrong, because their FCFF margin and price of iron ore and capacity of the mine varied over time, its safe to say they have made profit on the acquisition.",

Also he refers to Buffett a lot - but this is not a Warren-esque portfolio. Warren always had top quality companies leading the charge, albeit at higher PEs.

Due to the concentrated nature of his bets, there could be one year in the next five where he outperforms by 30-40%. For example, if we have a repeat of 2021, where mag 7 crashes and coal / oil companies soar, this could realistically happen. So, I think the  probability is closer to 80% that he underperforms over the next five years and 20% that he catches up/outperforms.",

You can trick people's perception of reality with accounting, but your job as an investor is to not be tricked. If that makes sense.\n\nSo let's say company needs to buy a new machine every 10 years. By the 10th year, the machine is fully depreciated so their Return on Book Value looks huge! But you as a savvy investor will not be tricked by this. Because you know that the machine has to be replaced with a new machine.\n\n>From this viewpoint, could depreciation be a good thing? Or is depreciation always a cost preferred to be limited.\n\nAll else being equal, you would want lower depreciation. This means that the company has less expenditures. But what you don't want is for the depreciation line item to mislead you.\n\nFor example, if a company has increasing capital expenditures, then depreciation will always understate capital expenditures. That's just how the math works out. I recommend just opening up a spreadsheet and seeing for yourself why that's the case. Use a straight-line method over 10 years. Increase the cap ex, and you'll see how the depreciation number naturally lags.",

See below the summary of the analysis I run on them few weeks ago.\n\nTradeweb - $TW\n\nTradeweb (TW) is a solid company with strong fundamentals, but the current valuation is hard to justify. Let\u2019s start with the good stuff: They crushed Q1 2025 with 24.7% revenue growth and an impressive 54.6% adjusted EBITDA margin. That\u2019s thanks to strong trading volumes, a smooth integration of the ICD acquisition, and their leading position in electronic trading. On top of that, they have a debt-free balance sheet and $1.3 billion in cash, giving them a lot of flexibility. Their push into AI and global markets also fits right into the broader shift toward electronification in finance. Now the issue: The stock trades at a PE of 57, with a current price of $137 about 71% above my fair value estimate of $80. My take? Great company, but I\u2019d wait for a pullback before jumping in. FYI I used \u201cAskcharly\u201d to gather all these insights.\n\nIbotta - $IBTA\n\nIbotta\u2019s outlook is a bit of a mixed bag, but there\u2019s reason for cautious optimism. On the downside, Q1 2025 had some red flags: revenue growth slowed to just 3% year-over-year, gross margins dropped from 87% to 80%, and net income fell 94%. That hit came mainly from higher revenue-sharing costs with publishers and increased spend on R&D and operations. Share dilution is another concern; outstanding shares jumped 17% YoY, which is eating into per-share metrics even though the company\u2019s been buying back stock. These pressures show the challenges of Ibotta\u2019s ongoing shift toward third-party partnerships (like Instacart and DoorDash) and rolling out new ad tech. Execution risk is real in the short term. That said, Ibotta still has solid fundamentals. The balance sheet is strong, $297.5 million in cash and no debt and they pulled in $19.9 million in operating cash flow in Q1. Long term, they\u2019re well-positioned to ride the wave of AI-powered, omnichannel digital promotions. Valuation-wise, the stock looks attractive. My fair value estimate is $86, which suggests more than 100% upside. If you\u2019re considering getting in, it\u2019s smart to wait for clearer signs like better cost control and early wins from new partnerships. Keep an eye on future earnings for improvements in gross margins and dilution.",

They're showing signs of gaining market share in North America. \n\nThey've got booking for hotels, cars (rental cars) , restaurants (OpenTable). They've also been adding in hosts who can rent out their house to travelers like Airbnb does. \n\nThey're not capital intensive, so they've got great operating leverage. They're growing their revenue quite consistently the last 5-10 years, despite COVID setback. \n\nThey buy back shares *aggressively*, so their FCF per share is growing faster than their revenue. Same as EPS, Profit, which are growing faster than revenue. \n\nThey're so big and powerful, that their major tailwind would be regulation going after them. And they did in September 2024 where they couldn't require hotels to *not* have lower prices on their website versus on Booking Holdings. \n\nIf done well, I can see AI helping their business, to help people plan out their travel.",

That&#39;s the main reason for an ongoing loss and cash burn. \n \nConclusion: \n \nThere is a need to eliminate, or way pare down, the debt. Higher margins would eventually take care of that problem but the need is too pressing to rely just on that. Imo a sale of shares in the $3-4 range would do it.

After hearing apple execs  interview I could only think about Google. \n\nCraig said that when the internet came the analists asked \"why are you not building search engine?\"\" Why are you not creating an online retail store? Why are you not creating an internet  provider?\"\n\nThe internet created massive opportunities and apple grabbed the ones they knew how to make. \n\nThat's their answer for why are they not creating a chatbot? There are oportunities for chat bots, and much much more. Apple sells equipment for everyone, kids, teens, adults, seniors, not everyone want to go to a chat bot to resume an email ... What if the email could be resumed right in your email? Help analise a PDF, memorize something by a photo, edit your photo ... Ai on device will be massive. Way bigger than a chatbot, that's why open ai bought Johny Ives company. They know they need A device. That's why Facebook is full throttle on Oculus and Ray-Bans. \n\nAnd you know what? Google owns everything, and have their hands on the stuff they don't own. They have laptops, smartphones, they have OS on multiple plataforms. Browser, car, phone, watches, computer, earphones... They have AR. And you know what? They have the best ai engineers in the world, 4 of them freaking won a Nobel. They invented ai as we know. Google brain, and deepmind now together. They will put ai in every step of our hands and eyes. \n\nAnd if apple drops 10% more I will start building a position there too. \n\nFreaking alphabet is insane.",

But that is still a long ways off. For now, their liquid assets will account for $20.71/share if the extra option on the note offering is fully utilized as it was last quarter.\n\nOne more of these offerings and the company's liquid assets will exceed my cost basis.

        "text": "I like ASTS, but people are easily misled IMO by their \"Space 5G Cellular Broadband\" marketing. It is physically impossible for even low-band 5G mobiles' radios to reach Earth orbit, even 4G. You're still looking at 2G/3G-like speeds for mobile devices in the best case, at least for now. Data compression and dedicated channels/lanes can help, but the limiting factor in mobiles will remain antenna size/gain and power consumption required to reach orbit. 5G-like bandwidth *between satellites* is no problem. Where I see their tech possibly shining is in mobile hotspots. \n\nFor comparison, Starlink uses \\~8 phased array antennas in the Ku/Ka/E-bands (ranging \\~12-90GHz). It averages \\~250 Megabits/sec down and \\~20 up, best case, at a power draw of \\~100 watts. \n\nASTS is working in the L-band range (\\~1.5 GHz). A bit of *likely wrong* math \\[(1.5/90\\*(250)) gives us \\~4 Megabits/sec. Divide that by 8 phased-array antennas and you're looking at \\~0.5 Mbps or 500 Kbps/per. Again, this is best case and realistically it's going to be half that or less (per channel). SD video and streaming music territory in optimum conditions.\n\nA news article here: [https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/ast-spacemobile-satellite-messaging-isn-t-cool-but-satellite-broadband-is](https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/ast-spacemobile-satellite-messaging-isn-t-cool-but-satellite-broadband-is)\n\nUsing ASTS' numbers from the article: 20MBit/sec divided by 2800 cells is \\~8Kbps. Assuming 16-64 cells *max* allocation per device connection and we're looking at... 128-512Kbps. Pretty close to our original estimate! Where we can ramp up these numbers significantly is through using *constellations* of satellites so we're not communicating with just one, but multiples at the same time. That takes more power, however.\n\nTake a mobile phone with a 5000mAh battery pulling 2-3 watts to support this, and your phone's charge is cooked in just over an hour. I'm sure most people have experienced their phone getting warm/draining battery when searching for signal, it's because the amplifier is working overtime while your phone is hunting for a network.\n\nFull disclosure: I hold shares of ASTS as I think they are in a decent position to make SATCOM-for-all more reasonably attainable than Starlink.

Let's assume they have 1000 of these next-gen satellites with a clear line-of-sight in the sky and a faultless connection to make the math easier. Now we're at 120 Gigabits/sec (theoretical). Sweet.\n\nThe population of smartphone users in the U.S. is \\~ 300mm. Average smartphone usage is \\~15 GigaBytes a month or 120 Gigabits/month. Numbers are weird! ~~120 Gigabits divided by 2,592,000 seconds (30 days) gives you \\~5.8KiloBytes/sec or \\~46 Kilobits/sec. Dialup.~~\n\nEdit: My math in public is lacking: \\[(120 gigabits per sec / 300 mm users) = **50 BYTES/sec or 400 BITS/sec.**\n\nNow, assuming they have a 1000-satellite constellation, and we use the FCC definition of broadband (100Mbps down/20Mbps up):\n\nYou ready for this?\n\nThey can serve **~~1200 users~~** (edit: **1000** users, even fewer, forgot to account for uplink) at 100% utilization, but the number is going to be less due to congestion and other factors.\n\nConservatively, we can multiply that by a factor of 10 with a relatively good quality of service. So let's say 12,000, as there will be some time-sharing of resources, and those people will still have a good experience.\n\nThat still gives them 12Megabits/sec (theoretical, before *any* losses). That would be enough for me to call it *broadband*.\n\nSay all people want to do is stream at 720p, decent for a mobile device. At 3.5Mbps they can support around 34,000 users...with 1000 satellites.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this tech matures for sure!",

Assume that the company you like is too well known and thus will \\*never\\* provide good value - there are plenty of companies that fall into this category where they're just super great businesses that are very well run and everybody knows it and wants to participate. It's possible that they may fall to your MOS price - or even near it - some day, but that day wont be any time soon, so you're better off watching other stocks.\n\n2.) Wait and collect interest on your cash as you save it up or use government bonds to eek out just a little more - SGOV is a nice alternative to money market funds.\n\n3.) Get your brokerage account options enabled and sell cash secured puts at or near your MOS price (Phil has several episodes of the podcast where they describe doing this).\n\nLet's do a quick example of #3. I really like google, but I don't think google is safe until it's at 98$ a share. I can sell a long dated put for January 2027, at 100$ (close enough to $98). To be cash secured I need to be able to \"put up\" $10,000 (100 shares at 100$ dollars) which is securing the put. Right now the price of this put last sold at 4.95. Basically you would earn 495$ in premium, to put up $10,000 on google. If you spend till January of 2027 and google never falls below 100$ you keep the $495 bucks. If it falls below 100$, you still keep the 495$ but you get the 100 shares at 100$. Subtracting the 495$ you got, you actually will only pay \\~95$ a share. If it falls below 95, you're losing money and would have been better off to have sat on your cash.\n\nIf you had instead just put the $10000 in SGOV, and waited until January 2027, you wouldn't be risking your 10k, and would earn \\~600 in interest \\*if\\* interest rates don't go down (they may). So at least in this experiment, it's not worth selling the put. it is, however, possible to get higher prices (you can set what you're willing to pay - in this case you can put out an ask for something over $600). On days with especially high market volatility puts will often command higher premium (or if say google gets lots of bad news).\n\n\\-------\n\nThe Shiller PE, while not super gospel truth, is also a good indicator of how easy it will be to find value. We're well above the historical average of 15-16, at 30+, so it's going to be much harder to find value.",

Companies like Business Insider have lost traffic due to forces out of their control which has lead to layoffs.\n\nChegg CEO Nathan Schultz told investors: \u201cWe would not need to review strategic alternatives if Google hadn\u2019t launched AI Overviews, **retaining traffic that historically had come to Chegg,** materially impacting our acquisitions, revenue, and employees.\u201d\n\nThe internet is in trouble if people resort to only using AI solutions, since AI uses data from other sites but doesn't give those sites any traffic. Eventually, free sites will either close or lock down behind authentication and paywalls. And at that point, where will AI get the data to answer questions?",

But the latest models, which are more sophisticated and promise humanlike reasoning, have spurred a surge of new use. ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users in March, rising from 300 million in December. Many of them pay $20 a month for service; parent company OpenAI says it reached an annualized revenue run rate of $10 billion this month, up from $5.5 billion at year end.\n\nAnother start-up, Perplexity, has taken on Google more directly. \u201cA direct line to the world\u2019s knowledge\u2014compressed, cited, and made clear,\u201d Perplexity says on its about page. \u201cNo gimmicks. No fluff. Just answers that make sense.\u201d\n\n(Barron\u2019s owner Dow Jones has sued Perplexity for copyright infringement.)\n\nAs AI pressure mounts on Google, the company has moved to defend its 89% U.S. market share in search. A year ago, it launched so-called AI Overviews atop Google search results, promising condensed AI-generated answers to search queries.\n\nThose overviews, which initially appeared on a small number of searches, have been appearing more frequently. An analysis by research firm Ahrefs said that the prevalence of AI Overviews have more than doubled from March 12 to May 6.\n\nThe AI summaries have spurred debate across the internet, with publishers worried about a search query that delivers answers in a few paragraphs, with no need to click for more info. According to Similarweb data from March, searches with AI Overviews resulted in a click 23% of the time. For searches without the overviews, the click rate was 36%.\n\n\u201cLooking at search results that do show an AI answer, comparing that with search results that do not show an answer, we found a crazy drop-off,\u201d said Kevin Indig, a search-engine optimization, or SEO, consultant and author of the Growth Memo blog. \u201cThis is a click killer.\u201d\n\nGoogle told Barron\u2019s that third-party data offer an incomplete picture of search trends.\n\nIn February, online education platform Chegg said search trends had crushed its business. CEO Nathan Schultz told investors: \u201cWe would not need to review strategic alternatives if Google hadn\u2019t launched AI Overviews, retaining traffic that historically had come to Chegg, materially impacting our acquisitions, revenue, and employees.\u201d",

It alleges that Google is using its search dominance to \u201ccoerce online publishers like Chegg to supply content that Google republishes without permission in AI-generated answers that unfairly compete for the attention of users on the internet.\u201d\n\nChegg shares have tumbled 99% since 2021.\n\nGoogle says its AI Overviews have improved the search experience and are being embraced by users. A Google spokesperson says that AI Overviews show more links to a wider range of sources on results pages.\n\n\u201cMore than any other company, Google prioritizes sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day,\u201d the Google spokesperson told Barron\u2019s.\n\nIn April, during Google\u2019s earnings call, an analyst asked company executives about the impact that AI Overviews was having on click-through rates. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the moment to go into the details of click-through rates and conversion and so on,\u201d said Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer. \u201cBut overall, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Heavy Construction\u2019\n\nReddit has become a battle ground and flashpoint in the argument about search\u2019s future.

The company remains a standout in search, and it points out that \u201cReddit\u201d is the No. 6 searched term on Google. Still, traffic trends have notably shifted in recent months. In May 2024, Reddit\u2019s search referrals soared 78%, according to Similarweb. This past May, searches to the site were up 14%.\n\nReddit\u2019s daily user growth, meanwhile, has gone from 37% in the first quarter of 2024 to 31% in 2025.\n\nReddit Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Wong said in an interview with Barron\u2019s that search is under \u201cheavy construction.\u201d Wong is confident about the long-term opportunity for Reddit, noting that its human-generated content will be especially sought after to train the large language models that run AI. Reddit has a deal with OpenAI. For now, that kind of licensing is a small part of the business, accounting for less than 9% of revenue in the most recent quarter.",

Across 29 analysts covering Reddit, the average price target is $152, 31% above its recent close.\n\nGoing forward, investors should pay attention to a company\u2019s search exposure. Across the categories, certain brands are far less dependent on Google\u2019s referrals. Airbnb, for instance, got 14% of referrals from search in March, versus the 58% for travel firm Tripadvisor, according to Semrush. DoorDash and Uber Technologies were 13%. Social-media apps like Pinterest and Meta Platform\u2019s Instagram also tend to be far less search-dependent than much of the internet. Their sites drew 23% and 17% of referrals from search, respectively.\n\nIn May, Pinterest\u2019s CEO told investors that 85% of users come directly to the company\u2019s mobile app.\n\nHedging Against Search\n\nMeta Platforms, which essentially shares the online advertising pie with Google, is in an enviable position. As search traffic falls and traditional search advertising wanes, businesses will be compelled to advertise on Instagram and Facebook, Meta\u2019s social networks that are insulated from search disruption.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta can use AI to improve ad effectiveness and personalization. As Google defends itself against AI, Meta is free to fully embrace it.\n\nUltimately, the best hedge against AI disruption is the company empowering it all: Nvidia\nAs AI explodes, Nvidia will sell more AI chips and the infrastructure to power data centers. Newer reasoning-focused AI models are particularly profitable for Nvidia because they require 100 times the computing resources compared with prior AI chatbots, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings call. \u201cReasoning models are driving a step-function surge in inference demand,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom Disrupter to Disrupted\n\nAs Google Search comes under threat for the first time in two decades, a U.S. district judge is determining the company\u2019s fate. Judge Amit Mehta ruled in August 2024 that Google was a monopoly in general search services and general text advertising.\n\nAlphabet and its investors are now waiting for the judge to determine potential remedies. A penalty phase of the trial concluded last month, and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision in August.\n\nThe timing is notable. Alphabet was ruled a monopoly around the same time that it was pushing out AI Overviews. Less than a year later, search is facing a massive competitive shift as users increasingly embrace chatbots.\n\nApple\u2019s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, testified that searches in Apple browsers fell for the first time in April as people increasingly turned to AI for search queries. Google pays billions of dollars to Apple annually to make its search engine the default option on Apple browsers.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect Google\u2019s recent weakness to affect Mehta\u2019s decision.",

We\u2019re looking at what they did in the past,\u201d Haynes said.\n\nThat past includes one of the best business models ever created. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s operating margin was 32% versus an aggregate 14% for S&P 500 index companies. Meanwhile, since Alphabet went public in 2004, the stock has returned an annualized 23.7%, versus 10.6% for the S&P 500.\n\nA post-search world will probably weigh on those margins, but Alphabet stock already reflects the next phase. It trades at 17.8 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, below the S&P 500\u2019s 22.5 multiple.\n\nBarron\u2019s has remained bullish on the stock, including in a November 2024 cover story and a follow-up last month.\n\nGoogle will be fine. It\u2019s the rest of the internet that should be worried.\n\nWrite to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com, Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com",
